<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This book is offered to the public, not to be classed with elaborate or
learned works, nor expected, like some of its more pretending companions
among the offspring of the press, to run the gauntlet of literary
criticism. It was prepared to meet the wants of persons&mdash;numbered by
<i>multitudes</i> in even the most intelligent and refined communities&mdash;who
from deficiency of education, or from carelessness of manner, are in the
habit of misusing many of the most common words of the English language,
distorting its grammatical forms, destroying its beauty, and corrupting
its purity. The most thorough mode that could be adopted to correct such
errors, would doubtless be to impart to the ignorant a practical knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>of the principles of language, as embodied in treatises on grammar; but
such a good work, however desirable its results, has, in time past, been
too difficult for the promoters of education to complete, and is still too
great to give promise of speedy accomplishment. A better expedient,
bearing immediate fruits, has been adopted in the present volume, which,
while it does not aim to produce a radical reform, cannot fail to render
great service to those who need to improve their usual modes of
expression, and to be more discriminating in their choice of words.</p>

<p>The more frequent and less excusable mistakes that may be noticed in
ordinary conversation or correspondence, are here taken up, one by
one&mdash;exposed, explained, and corrected. They consist variously of abuses
of grammar, misapplications of words and phrases, improprieties of
metaphor and comparison, misstatements of meaning, and faults of
pronunciation. They are grouped miscellaneously, <i>without classification</i>,
not so much because of the difficulty of devising an arrangement that
would be systematic and intelligible, as from the evident fact that a
division of subjects would render no assistance to those for whom the book
is specially designed; for an appropriate classification would necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>derive its features from the forms of grammar, and with these the readers
of this book are supposed to be to a great extent unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The volume is put forth with no flourish of trumpets, and makes no
extravagant pretensions; yet the publishers believe it will be regarded as
a timely and useful work. If the race of <i>critics</i> should not like it&mdash;and
while books have their &#8220;faults,&#8221; critics have their &#8220;failings&#8221;&mdash;they are
reminded that he who corrects an old error, may render no less service to
his brethren, than he who discovers a new truth. If the work shall be the
means of saving one sensitive man from a confusion of blushes, in the
presence of a company before which he desired to preserve his equanimity,
it will not have gone forth without a mission of benefit, which will merit
at least one acknowledgment.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The aim of this book, by correcting a multitude of common errors in the
use of language, is mainly to offer assistance to such persons as need
greater facilities for accurate expression <i>in ordinary conversation</i>. It
is not designed to suggest topics of talk, nor to give rules or examples
pointing out the proper modes of arranging them; but simply to insure
persons who often have a good thing to say, from the confusion and
mortification of improperly saying it. This chapter of introduction will
not, therefore, be expected to present an essay on the general subject of
conversation.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, however, by way of admonitory hint to some, that the
most prominent error in the conversation of those who commit the most
blunders, does not consist in saying too little that amounts to much, but
too much that amounts to little; talkativeness is a characteristic more
commonly of the ignorant, than of the wise. Shenstone says, &#8220;The common
fluency of speech in many men, and most women, is owing to a scarcity of
matter and a scarcity of words; for whoever is master of a language, and
moreover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> has a mind full of ideas, will be apt, in speaking, to hesitate
upon the choice of both; but common speakers have only one set of ideas
and one set of words to clothe them in,&mdash;and these are always ready at the
mouth. Just so, <i>people can come faster out of a church when it is almost
empty, than when a crowd is at the door</i>!&#8221; But although, according to the
old proverb, &#8220;a still tongue denotes a wise head,&#8221; the faculty of speech
should not be neglected, merely because it may be misused.</p>

<p>Conversation is not a gift bestowed only upon those whom genius favors; on
the contrary, many men eminent for their fluency of style in writing, have
been noted for habitual taciturnity in their intercourse with society.
Hazlitt remarked, that &#8220;authors should be read, not heard!&#8221; Charles II. of
England, not only the wittiest of monarchs, but one of the liveliest of
men, is said to have been so charmed in reading the humor of Butler&#8217;s
&#8220;Hudibras,&#8221; that he disguised himself as a private gentleman, and was
introduced to the author, whom, to his astonishment, he found to be one of
the <i>dullest</i> of companions. On the other hand, some of the humblest men
with whom one falls into company, possessed of but little variety, and
less extent of information, are highly entertaining talkers. The
particular topic of remark does not form so essential a part of an
interesting conversation, as the words and manner of those who engage in
it. Robert Burns, sitting down on one occasion to write a poem, said:</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
&#8220;Which way the subject theme may gang,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let time or chance determine;</span><br />
Perhaps it may turn out a sang,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or probably a sermon.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>In the same manner, the subject of a conversation need not be made a
matter of study, or special preparation. Men may talk of things momentous
or trivial, and in either strain be alike attractive and agreeable.</p>

<p>But quitting the consideration of the thought, to refer to the mode of its
expression, it must be remarked and insisted, that to &#8220;murder the king&#8217;s
English&#8221; is hardly less a crime, than to design against one of the king&#8217;s
subjects. If committed from ignorance, the fault is at least deplorable;
but if from carelessness, it is inexcusable. The greatest of sciences is
that of language; the greatest of human arts is that of using words. No
&#8220;cunning hand&#8221; of the artificer can contrive a work of mechanism that is
to be compared, for a moment, with those wonderful masterpieces of
ingenuity, which may be wrought by him who can skilfully mould a beautiful
thought into a form that shall preserve, yet radiate its beauty. A mosaic
of words may be made more fair, than of inlaid precious stones. The
scholar who comes forth from his study, a master of the English language,
is a workman who has at his command hardly less than a hundred thousand
finely-tempered instruments, with which he may fashion the most cunning
device. This is a trade which all should learn, for it is one that every
individual is called to practise. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> greatest support of virtue in a
community is intelligence; intelligence is the outgrowth of knowledge; and
the almoner of all knowledge is language. The possession, therefore, of
the resources, and a command over the appliances of language, is of the
utmost importance to every individual. Words are current coins of the
realm, and they who do not have them in their treasury, suffer a more
pitiable poverty than others who have not a penny of baser specie in their
pocket; and the multitude of those who have an unfailing supply, but which
is of the wrong stamp, are possessed only of counterfeit cash, that will
not pass in circles of respectability. The present work therefore is, in
some respects, not unlike the &#8220;Detector&#8221; issued for the merchants, to
indicate the great amount of worthless money that is in general
circulation with the good.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that all the mistakes of daily occurrence in the
use of language, are to be numbered by &#8220;five hundred&#8221;&mdash;possibly not by
five thousand; but it is evident that he who is instructed against five
hundred of his habitual blunders, and enabled to steer clear of every one
of them, has in no slight degree improved his conversation, and thereby
increased his importance. As a prefix, or accompaniment, to this catalogue
of corrected mistakes, the presentation of a few rules or principles of
language, which, strictly observed, might guard against numerous general
classes of errors, would not be thought misplaced, or undesirable. Some
suggestions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> points most prominent are accordingly given among these
introductory remarks&mdash;not in formal statements of grammatical rules, but
in examples in which the spirit of such rules is revealed.</p>

<p>Not the least glaring among the many misuses of words and forms of
expression in conversation, occur by incorrectly employing the
pronouns&mdash;<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, and <i>that</i>. It may be remarked, that
<i>who</i> should be applied exclusively to persons. <i>Which</i> usually refers to
animals and inanimate objects, except in such an expression as, &#8220;Tell me
<i>which</i> of the two men was chosen?&#8221; <i>What</i>, means <i>that which</i>: thus,
&#8220;This is the book <i>what</i> I wanted,&#8221; should read, &#8220;This is the book <i>that</i>
(or <i>which</i>) I wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among interrogatives, <i>who?</i> inquires for the name; <i>which?</i> for the
individual; <i>what?</i> for the character, or occupation. Thus, &#8220;<i>Who</i> built
the bridge?&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Blake.&#8221; &#8220;<i>Which</i> of the Blakes?&#8221; &#8220;<i>Charles</i> Blake.&#8221;
&#8220;<i>What</i> was he?&#8221; &#8220;A distinguished civil engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The title of a small book for young people, recently published, was&mdash;&#8220;The
Way <i>that</i> Little Children enter Heaven:&#8221; the word <i>that</i> is here
incorrectly used as a substitute for <i>in which</i>, or <i>by which</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, and their plurals, are used in the sense of
<i>latter</i> and <i>former</i>, <i>this</i> and <i>these</i> signify the <i>latter</i>, and <i>that</i>
and <i>those</i> the <i>former</i>. Thus, in the following couplet from Burns:</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
&#8220;Farewell my friends, farewell my foes,<br />
My peace with <i>these</i>, my love with <i>those</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>these</i> refers to &#8220;foes,&#8221; and <i>those</i> to &#8220;friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the possessive case of nouns, some instances occur in which a wise
choice may be made, but in respect to which usage is divided. Thus, we may
say, &#8220;They called at <i>Walton&#8217;s the bookseller&#8217;s</i>,&#8221; or, with equal
propriety, as far as custom is concerned, &#8220;at <i>Walton the bookseller&#8217;s</i>.&#8221;
The first form, however, is preferable.</p>

<p>The use of the hyphen [-] is frequently disregarded in epistolary
correspondence, occasioning not only a blemish but a blunder. Its
importance may be seen by comparing the meaning of &#8220;<i>glass house</i>&#8221; with
&#8220;<i>glass-house</i>;&#8221; the former may mean the Crystal Palace, while the latter
is a manufactory of glass-ware.</p>

<p>Adjectives are often improperly used for adverbs: as, &#8220;<i>extreme</i> bad
weather,&#8221; for &#8220;<i>extremely</i> bad weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to choose between such phrases as &#8220;the <i>first
three</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;the <i>three first</i>.&#8221; To say <i>first three</i> when there is no
<i>second three</i> is inelegant, because superfluous; and <i>three first</i> is
absurd, because impossible. The most successful pupil in each of two
classes at school would not improperly be called &#8220;the <i>two first boys</i>;&#8221;
while propriety would require that the first and second boys of the same
class should be called &#8220;the <i>first two boys</i>.&#8221; As a general rule, and easy
to be recollected, let <i>&#8220;first&#8221; be first</i>.</p>

<p>The use of <i>some</i> for <i>about</i> is by many writers thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> to be awkward:
as, &#8220;<i>Some</i> fifty years ago,&#8221; instead of &#8220;<i>About</i> Fifty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>An ambiguity occasionally arises in employing the adjective <i>no</i>. Thus,
&#8220;No money is better than gold,&#8221; may mean either that gold is the best kind
of money, or that gold is not so good as <i>no money at all</i>!</p>

<p>After numerals, the words <i>couple</i>, <i>pair</i>, <i>dozen</i>, <i>score</i>, <i>hundred</i>,
<i>thousand</i>, and a few others, need not take the plural form: thus, custom
first, and finally grammar, have sanctioned such uses as, &#8220;three <i>pair</i> of
shoes,&#8221; &#8220;nine <i>dozen</i> bushels,&#8221; &#8220;four <i>couple</i> of students;&#8221; also, &#8220;<i>forty
sail</i> of vessels,&#8221; &#8220;seventy <i>head</i> of cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The article (<i>a</i> or <i>an</i>) renders an important service in such expressions
as, &#8220;<i>A few</i> followed their leader throughout the long struggle.&#8221; To say,
&#8220;<i>Few</i> followed him,&#8221; would imply, unlike the former phrase, that he was
almost deserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A black and a white horse,&#8221; suggests the idea of two horses; while &#8220;a
black and white horse,&#8221; refers to but one&mdash;as if written &#8220;a
<i>black-and-white</i> horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The red and white dahlias were most admired,&#8221; properly means the dahlias
in which both these colors were blended. &#8220;The red and <i>the</i> white
dahlias,&#8221; implies two species.</p>

<p>The grammatical number of a verb should agree with that of its subject,
and not of its predicate. Thus, the sentences, &#8220;Death <i>is</i> the wages of
sin,&#8221; and &#8220;The wages of sin <i>are</i> death,&#8221; are properly written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>In changing from a past tense to the present, when the same nominative
remains, the form of the verb should continue unaltered. Thus, instead of
saying &#8220;He <i>was traveling</i> and <i>travels</i>,&#8221; say &#8220;He <i>was traveling</i> and <i>is
traveling</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a verb has both a singular and a plural nominative, separated by
<i>or</i>, its number agrees with that of the <i>nearer</i>: as, &#8220;the cup or his
<i>billiards were</i> his ruin;&#8221; or, &#8220;his billiards or the <i>cup was</i> his ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Custom&mdash;which, when <i>crystallized</i>, becomes grammar&mdash;allows expressions
like &#8220;The linen <i>tears</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;The meadow <i>plows</i> well,&#8221; although they
should not be frequently employed, and should be more seldom coined.</p>

<p>A fruitful source of mistakes in language, is in the linking together of
two or more inappropriate tenses, or in the misuse of one. Many among the
learned and refined commit blunders of these kinds. A few corrected
examples of such are here given:</p>

<p>&#8220;His text was, that God <i>was</i> love;&#8221; the sentence should be written, &#8220;His
text was, that God <i>is</i> love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord <i>hath given</i>, and the Lord hath taken away;&#8221; say, &#8220;The Lord
<i>gave</i>, and the Lord hath taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>arrived</i> before we left the city:&#8221; say, &#8220;they <i>had arrived</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the brothers <i>have been</i> greatly indebted to their father:&#8221; say,
&#8220;<i>are indebted</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This painting <i>was preserved and exhibited</i> for the last century:&#8221; say,
&#8220;<i>has been</i> preserved and exhibited.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>&#8220;It was the last act he intended <i>to have performed</i>.&#8221; say, &#8220;<i>to
perform</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>drinks</i> wine at dinner,&#8221; means that such is his habit; &#8220;he <i>is
drinking</i> wine at dinner,&#8221; refers to one particular time and occasion.</p>

<p>Adverbs are often inelegantly used instead of adjectives; as, &#8220;the <i>then</i>
ministry,&#8221; for &#8220;the ministry of that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the phrases &#8220;<i>never</i> so good,&#8221; or, &#8220;<i>ever</i> so good,&#8221; as to whether one
is preferable to the other, authority is divided. Modern usage inclines to
the latter, while ancient preferred the former, as in the Scriptural
expression, &#8220;charm he <i>never</i> so wisely.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Yea</i> and <i>nay</i> are not equivalent to <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>; the latter are
directly affirmative and negative, while the former are variously
employed.</p>

<p>Of prepositions, it has been frequently said, that no words in the
language are so liable to be incorrectly used. For example, &#8220;The love <i>of</i>
God,&#8221; may mean either &#8220;His love to us,&#8221; or, &#8220;our love to Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many more of these particles are inelegantly, if not ambiguously used.
Instead of &#8220;the natives were a different race <i>to</i> what they are now,&#8221;
say, &#8220;different <i>from</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was made much <i>on</i> in the country:&#8221; say, &#8220;made much <i>of</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In compliance <i>of</i> your request:&#8221; say, &#8220;in compliance <i>with</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doubts <i>if</i> his friend will come,&#8221; is not so elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> and accurate as,
&#8220;He doubts <i>whether</i> his friend will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>More instances might be given, setting forth other frequent errors of
speaking and writing, at the risk, however, of destroying the due
proportion which should exist between the size of a work and the <i>length
of the Introduction</i>. But a good heed to what has been said in the few
preceding paragraphs, will enable a person who carefully reads this work
to mend his modes of expression, to no inconsiderable degree. It is well
known that there is no &#8220;royal road to learning,&#8221; but if there were, it
could hardly be expected that such a little book as this would afford a
passport to the end of the course. About two hundred years ago, a small
volume was put forth by one &#8220;John Peters, learned scholar and author,&#8221;
which had the following long-winded title: &#8220;A New Way to make Latin
Verses, whereby any one of ordinary capacity, that only <i>knows the A, B,
C</i> and can <i>count nine</i>, though he understands not <i>one word of Latin</i>, or
what a verse means, may be plainly taught to make thousands of Hexameter
and Pentameter Verses, which shall be true Latin, true Verse, and Good
Sense!&#8221; The present volume must not be expected to accomplish so great a
result as this&mdash;not having so comprehensive an aim, nor possessing so
great a secret of success. But it is hoped that it may incite some who are
unfortunately deficient in education, to seek so much additional knowledge
as shall enable them at least to converse in a dialect which is within the
compass of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> language of their country, and free them from the
imputation of belonging to another tribe of men, speaking another tongue.</p>

<p>A Welshman, residing near Caermarthon, who was seldom seen at the only
church in the parish of his residence, was one day accosted by the worthy
clergyman with the question, &#8220;My friend&mdash;to what church do you belong?&#8221; He
responded, &#8220;To the Church of England.&#8221; &#8220;Ah,&#8221; replied the pastor, &#8220;I was
sure that it must be some church <i>out of Wales</i>!&#8221; There are not a few
persons who speak the English language about as truly as the Caermarthon
Welshman attended the English Church!</p>

<h2>FIVE HUNDRED MISTAKES CORRECTED.</h2>

<p>1. &#8220;The business would suit any one who <i>enjoys bad health</i>.&#8221; [From an
advertisement in a daily newspaper of New-York.] Few persons who have bad
health can be said to <i>enjoy it</i>. Use some other form of expression: as,
one <i>in delicate health</i>, or, one <i>whose health is bad</i>.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;We have no <i>corporeal</i> punishment here,&#8221; said a schoolmaster.
<i>Corporeal</i> is opposed to <i>spiritual</i>. Say, <i>corporal</i> punishment.
<i>Corporeal</i> means having a body.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;She is a <i>notable</i> woman,&#8221; as was said of the wife of the Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain,&mdash;meaning <i>careful</i>, and pronounced as though divided
<i>not-able</i>. This word is no longer current, with this pronunciation or
signification, except to a slight extent in England. It has become
obsolete, and its use now is in bad taste.</p>

<p>4. &#8220;Insert the <i>advertisement</i> in the Weekly.&#8221; Emphasize <i>vert</i>, and not
<i>ise</i>.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;He <i>rose up</i>, and left the room:&#8221; leave out <i>up</i>, as it is absurd to
say <i>rise down</i>. The Irishman who was <i>hoisted down</i> the coal pit, did not
observe this rule.</p>

<p>6. &#8220;<i>Set down</i> and rest yourself:&#8221; say <i>sit down</i>; <i>setting</i> is said of
the sun in the west, but cannot be properly applied to a person taking a
seat. &#8220;Sit <i>down</i>&#8221; is not improper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> though &#8220;rise <i>up</i>&#8221; (as in No. 5)
should never be used. <i>Sitting down</i> expresses the act of appropriating a
chair, while <i>sitting up</i> means <i>sitting erect</i>. <i>Sitting up</i> also refers
to watching during the night with the sick.</p>

<p>7. &#8220;You have <i>sown</i> it very neatly,&#8221; said a seamstress to her apprentice:
say <i>sewed</i>, and pronounce so as to rhyme with <i>road</i>. The pronunciation
of <i>sew</i>, meaning &#8220;to use the needle,&#8221; violates its spelling; it is the
same as that of <i>sow</i>, meaning &#8220;to scatter seed.&#8221;</p>

<p>8. &#8220;This is a secret between <i>you and I</i>:&#8221; say, <i>you and me</i>. The
construction requires the objective case in place of <i>I</i>, which is in the
nominative. It is in still better taste to say, &#8220;This is a secret <i>with</i>
you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>9. &#8220;Let <i>you and I</i> take a walk:&#8221; say, Let <i>you and me</i>, or, <i>Let us</i>. Who
would think of saying, <i>Let I go</i>? The expression &#8220;Let <i>I and you</i>&#8221; is
frequently heard, which contains the additional impropriety of putting the
first person before the second.</p>

<p>10. &#8220;He is going to <i>learn his brother</i> Alfred how to knit nets:&#8221; say,
<i>teach</i>. The act of <i>communicating</i> instruction is expressed by
&#8220;teaching,&#8221; the act of <i>receiving</i> it by &#8220;learning.&#8221; The distinction
between these words was made as early as the time of Shakespeare, and
cannot be violated without incurring censure.</p>

<p>11. &#8220;John and Henry both read well, but John is the <i>best</i> reader:&#8221; say,
the <i>better</i> reader, as <i>best</i> can be properly used only when <i>three or
more persons</i>, or objects, are compared.</p>

<p>12. &#8220;Thompson was there <i>among the rest</i>.&#8221; This mode of expression, which
is very common, literally declares an impossibility. The signification of
&#8220;the rest&#8221; is, those <i>in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> addition</i> to Thompson, and of which Thompson
formed <i>no part</i>; he could not therefore be <i>among</i> them. A more correct
form would be, &#8220;Thompson was there <i>with</i> the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>13. &#8220;The <i>two first</i> cows are the fattest,&#8221; said a farmer at an
agricultural fair. He should have said, &#8220;the <i>first two</i>;&#8221; there can be
only <i>one</i> that is <i>first</i>&mdash;the other must necessarily be <i>second</i>.</p>

<p>14. &#8220;It is an error; <i>you are mistaken</i>:&#8221; say, you <i>mistake</i>. <i>Mistaken</i>
means <i>misapprehended</i>; &#8220;you <i>mistake</i>,&#8221; means &#8220;you <i>misapprehend</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>15. &#8220;Have you <i>lit</i> the fire, Bridget?&#8221; say, <i>lighted</i>; <i>lit</i> is now
obsolete.</p>

<p>16. &#8220;To be is an <i>auxiliary</i> verb:&#8221; pronounce <i>auxiliary</i> as though
spelled <i>awg-zil-ya-re</i>, and not in five syllables.</p>

<p>17. <i>February</i>: this word is often incorrectly spelled by omitting the
<i>r</i>.</p>

<p>18. The &#8220;<i>Miscellany</i>&#8221; was an interesting publication: pronounce
<i>miscellany</i> with the accent on <i>mis</i>, and not on <i>cel</i>.</p>

<p>19. &#8220;<i>Celery</i> is a pleasant vegetable:&#8221; pronounce <i>celery</i> as it is
written, and not <i>salary</i>.</p>

<p>20. &#8220;Are you at <i>leisure</i>?&#8221; pronounce <i>lei</i> in <i>leisure</i> the same as
<i>lee</i>. The word should not rhyme with <i>measure</i>.</p>

<p>21. &#8220;John is my <i>oldest</i> brother:&#8221; say, <i>eldest</i>. <i>Elder and eldest</i> are
applied to <i>persons</i>&mdash;<i>older and oldest</i> to <i>things</i>. Usage, however, does
not make these distinctions imperative.</p>

<p>22. &#8220;The cloth was <i>wove</i> in a very short time:&#8221; say, <i>woven</i>.</p>

<p>23. &#8220;I prefer the <i>yolk</i> of an egg to the white:&#8221; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> more common word is
<i>yelk</i>, with the <i>l</i> sounded; but if <i>yolk</i> be used, it should be
pronounced like <i>yoke</i>.</p>

<p>24. <i>Sparrowgrass</i>: it is only the grossest ignorance which confounds this
word with <i>asparagus</i>. The same is the case with <i>ing-uns</i> for <i>onions</i>. A
man in an obscure section of New Jersey, inquiring at a country store for
<i>onions</i>, was told that there were none in the place. On his going out,
the storekeeper turned to half a dozen idlers sitting round the stove, and
said, &#8220;I wonder if that &#8217;tarnal fool meant <i>ing-uns</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>25. &#8220;You are very <i>mischievous</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>mischievous</i> with the accent
on <i>mis</i>, and not on <i>chie</i>, and do not say <i>mischievious</i>
(<i>mis-cheev-yus</i>).</p>

<p>26. The following words were posted, as a sign, in a reading-room&mdash;&#8220;No
Talking Allowed;&#8221; which was designed to prohibit all conversation. A wag
altered the inscription so as to read, &#8220;No Talking Aloud,&#8221; which (he
declared) did not prevent <i>whispering</i>, and chatting in <i>low tones</i>. What
shall be said of the following&mdash;&#8220;<i>No Smoking Aloud</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>27. &#8220;<i>No extras or vacations</i>:&#8221; [from the prospectus of a schoolmistress:]
say, <span class="smcap">nor</span> <i>vacations</i>.</p>

<p>28. &#8220;He was never known to be <i>covetous</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>covetous</i> as if
written <i>covet us</i>, and <i>not covetyus</i>.</p>

<p>29. <i>The Three R.&#8217;s.</i>&mdash;An ignorant and vain pedagogue, on being asked what
he could teach, replied, &#8220;The three R.&#8217;s&mdash;<i>&#8217;ritin&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8217;rethmetic</i>, and
<i>readin&#8217;</i>.&#8221; Any persons among the readers of this little book, who may
chance to be schoolmasters, are warned against giving such a course of
instruction.</p>

<p>30. &#8220;Dearly <i>beloved</i> brethren:&#8221; when <i>beloved</i> is placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> <i>before</i> the
noun, as in this instance, pronounce it in three syllables; when placed
<i>after</i>, in two syllables, as, &#8220;She was much <i>be-loved</i> by us all.&#8221; When
used as a noun by itself, it is pronounced in three syllables; as,
&#8220;<i>Be-lov-ed</i>, let us love one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>31. &#8220;Not <i>as I know</i>:&#8221; say, <i>that I know</i>.</p>

<p>32. &#8220;He came on purpose <i>for to do</i> it:&#8221; omit <i>for</i>.</p>

<p>33. &#8220;He would never believe <i>but what</i> I did it:&#8221; say, <i>but that</i> I did it.</p>

<p>34. &#8220;He is quite <i>as good as me</i>:&#8221; say, <i>as good as I</i>. Also, instead of
<i>as good as him</i>, say, <i>as good as he</i>. In both these instances <i>am</i> or
<i>is</i> must be mentally supplied at the end of the phrase, to suggest the
meaning; and the pronouns should, therefore, be in the nominative case.</p>

<p>35. &#8220;<i>Many an one</i> has done the same:&#8221; say, <i>many a one</i>. <i>A</i>, and <i>not
an</i>, is also used before the <i>long sound of u</i>, that is, when <i>u</i> forms <i>a
distinct syllable of itself</i>: as, <i>a unit</i>, <i>a union</i>, <i>a university</i>: it
is also used before <i>eu</i>: as, a <i>euphony</i>, and likewise before the word
<i>ewe</i>: as, <i>a ewe</i>: we should also say, <i>a youth</i>, not <i>an youth</i>.</p>

<p>36. &#8220;How do you like <i>these kind</i> of pears?&#8221; say, <i>these kinds</i>; a noun in
the singular number will not allow its adjective to be in the plural.</p>

<p>37. &#8220;You should have <i>went</i> home:&#8221; say, <i>gone</i>.</p>

<p>38. &#8220;John went with <i>James and I</i>:&#8221; say, <i>James and me</i>.</p>

<p>39. &#8220;I <i>see him</i> last Monday:&#8221; say, <i>saw him</i>.</p>

<p>40. &#8220;He was <i>averse from</i> such a proceeding:&#8221; say, <i>averse to</i>.</p>

<p>41. &#8220;Have you <i>shook</i> the table-cloth?&#8221; say, <i>shaken</i>.</p>

<p>42. &#8220;I have <i>rang</i> several times:&#8221; say, <i>rung</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>43. &#8220;I <i>know&#8217;d</i> him at once:&#8221; say, <i>knew</i>.</p>

<p>44. &#8220;You have <i>drank</i> too much of it:&#8221; say, <i>drunk</i>.</p>

<p>45. &#8220;He has <i>chose</i> a very poor pattern:&#8221; say, <i>chosen</i>.</p>

<p>46. &#8220;They have <i>broke</i> a window:&#8221; say, <i>broken</i>.</p>

<p>47. &#8220;I have just <i>began</i> my letter:&#8221; say, <i>begun</i>.</p>

<p>48. &#8220;Give me <i>them books</i>:&#8221; say, <i>those books</i>.</p>

<p>49. &#8220;Whose are <i>these here books</i>?&#8221; say, <i>these books</i>. <i>Here</i> is
superfluous and inelegant.</p>

<p>50. &#8220;<i>Who</i> do you mean?&#8221; say, <i>whom</i>.</p>

<p>51. &#8220;The men <i>which</i> we saw:&#8221; say, <i>whom</i>.</p>

<p>52. &#8220;The flowers <i>what</i> you have:&#8221; say, <i>which</i>, or <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>53. &#8220;The boy <i>as is</i> reading:&#8221; <i>who</i> is reading.</p>

<p>54. &#8220;It was <i>them</i> who did it:&#8221; say, <i>they</i>.</p>

<p>55. &#8220;<i>It is me</i> who am in fault:&#8221; say, <i>It is I</i>.</p>

<p>56. &#8220;Was it <i>her</i> who called me?&#8221; say, <i>she</i>.</p>

<p>57. &#8220;If I were <i>her</i>, I would accept his offer:&#8221; say, If I were <i>she</i>.</p>

<p>58. &#8220;He <i>has got</i> my slate:&#8221; omit <i>got</i>; <i>has</i> is sufficient for the
sense. The addition of <i>got</i>, though not ungrammatical, but gradually
becoming obsolete, does not in any degree strengthen the meaning.</p>

<p>59. &#8220;The pond is <i>froze</i>:&#8221; say, <i>frozen</i>.</p>

<p>60. &#8220;I know <i>I am him</i> whom he meant:&#8221; say, <i>I am he</i>.</p>

<p>61. &#8220;You cannot <i>catch</i> him:&#8221; pronounce <i>catch</i> so as to rhyme with
<i>match</i>, and not <i>ketch</i>&mdash;as the fishermen are in the habit of saying.</p>

<p>62. &#8220;<i>Who done it?</i>&#8221; say, <i>Who did it?</i></p>

<p>63. &#8220;The club gives an <i>impetus</i> to the ball:&#8221; pronounce <i>impetus</i> with
the stress on <i>im</i>, and not on <i>pe</i>.</p>

<p>64. &#8220;Spain and Portugal form a <i>peninsula</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>pen-in-su-la</i>,
with the accent on <i>in</i>, and not on <i>su</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>65. <i>Sar-da-na-pa-lus</i>: pronounce it with the accent on <i>pa</i>, and not on
<i>ap</i>. The latter pronunciation cannot be changed for the former, without
incurring a gross error.</p>

<p>66. &#8220;He must by this time be almost as far as the <i>antipodes</i>:&#8221; pronounce
<i>antipodes</i> with the accent on <i>tip</i>, and let <i>des</i> rhyme with <i>ease</i>; it
is a word of <i>four</i> syllables, and <i>not of three</i>.</p>

<p>67. <i>Vouchsafe</i>: a word seldom used, but when used, the first syllable
should rhyme with <i>pouch</i>; <i>never say vousafe</i>.</p>

<p>68. &#8220;The land in those parts is very <i>fertile</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>fertile</i> so as
to rhyme with <i>myrtle</i>. <i>Ile</i> in such words must be sounded as <i>ill</i>, with
the exception of <i>exile</i>, <i>senile</i>, <i>gentile</i>, <i>reconcile</i>, and
<i>camomile</i>, in which <i>ile</i> rhymes with <i>mile</i>.</p>

<p>69. <i>Benefited</i>: often spelt <i>benefitted</i>, but <i>incorrectly</i>.</p>

<p>70. &#8220;<i>Gather</i> a few ears of corn for dinner:&#8221; pronounce <i>gather</i> so as to
rhyme with <i>lather</i>, and <i>not gether</i>.</p>

<p>71. <i>Purpose and propose</i>: these two words, which are often confounded,
are entirely distinct in meaning. To <i>purpose</i> means <i>to intend</i>; <i>to
propose</i> means <i>to offer a proposition</i>.</p>

<p>72. <i>Directing and addressing letters</i>: <i>Directing</i> designates the persons
to whom, and the place to which the letter, as a parcel, is to be sent;
<i>addressing</i> refers to the individual to whom, as a communication, it is
written. A letter <i>addressed</i> to the President, may be <i>directed</i> to his
secretary.</p>

<p>73. &#8220;<i>Who</i> do you think I saw yesterday?&#8221; say, <i>Whom</i>.</p>

<p>74. A popular proverb is expressed in the following language: &#8220;Of <i>two</i>
evils choose the <i>least</i>;&#8221; say, <i>the less</i>. Of no less than <i>three</i> evils
can a person choose the <i>least</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>75. <i>Exaggerate</i>: pronounce <i>exad-gerate</i>, and <i>do not sound agger</i> as in
<i>dagger</i>.</p>

<p>76. <i>Ladies School</i>: the <i>usual</i> form, but <i>not correct</i>; write, <i>Ladies&#8217;
School</i>. The apostrophe (&#8217;) is thus used after nouns in the plural, and
indicates <i>possession</i>. In the singular, it is placed <i>before the s</i>, as,
<i>The lady&#8217;s school</i>.</p>

<p>77. The following equivocal notice is said to swing out on a sign-board
somewhere in the Western country: &#8220;<span class="smcap">Smith &amp; Huggs&mdash;Select School.</span>&mdash;<i>Smith
teaches the boys, and Huggs the girls.</i>&#8221; <i>Huggs needs correction!</i></p>

<p>78. &#8220;He keeps a <i>chaise</i>:&#8221; pronounce it <i>shaze</i>, and not <i>shay</i>; it has a
regular plural, <i>chaises</i>.</p>

<p>79. &#8220;The <i>drought</i> lasted a long time:&#8221; pronounce <i>drought</i> so as to rhyme
with <i>sprout</i>, and not <i>drowth</i>.</p>

<p>80. &#8220;The two friends <i>conversed together</i> for an hour:&#8221; omit <i>together</i>,
as the full meaning of this word is implied in <i>con</i>, which means <i>with</i>,
or <i>together</i>, or <i>in company</i>.</p>

<p>81. &#8220;The affair was <i>compromised</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>compromised</i> in three
syllables, and place the accent on <i>com</i>, sounding <i>mised</i> like <i>prized</i>.</p>

<p>82. &#8220;A <i>steam-engine</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>engine</i> with <i>en</i> as in <i>pen</i>, and <i>not
like in</i>; also, pronounce <i>gine</i> like <i>gin</i>.</p>

<p>83. &#8220;Several of the trappers were massacred by the Indians:&#8221; pronounce
<i>massacred</i> with the accent on <i>mas</i>, and <i>red</i> like <i>erd</i>, as if
<i>massaker&#8217;d</i>; never say <i>massacreed</i>, which is abominable.</p>

<p>84. &#8220;The King of Israel and the King of Judah sat <i>either of them</i> on his
throne:&#8221; say, <i>each of them</i>. <i>Either</i> signifies the <i>one</i> or the <i>other</i>,
but <i>not both</i>. <i>Each</i> relates to <i>two or more objects</i>, and signifies
<i>both of the two</i>, or <i>every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> of any number taken singly</i>. We can say,
&#8220;<i>either</i> of the three,&#8221; for &#8220;<i>one</i> of the three.&#8221;</p>

<p>85. &#8220;A <i>respite</i> was granted the convict:&#8221; pronounce <i>respite</i> with the
accent on <i>res</i>, and sound <i>pite</i> as <i>pit</i>.</p>

<p>86. &#8220;He soon <i>returned back</i>:&#8221; leave out <i>back</i>, which is implied by <i>re</i>
in <i>returned</i>.</p>

<p>87. &#8220;The ship looked like a speck on the edge of the <i>horizon</i>:&#8221; pronounce
<i>horizon</i> with the accent on <i>ri</i>, and not on <i>hor</i>, which is often the case.</p>

<p>88. &#8220;They were early at the <i>sepulchre</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>sepulchre</i> with the
accent on <i>sep</i>, and not on the second syllable.</p>

<p>89. &#8220;I have often <i>swam</i> across the Hudson:&#8221; say, <i>swum</i>.</p>

<p>90. &#8220;I found my friend better than I expected <i>to have found him</i>:&#8221; say, <i>to find him</i>.</p>

<p>91. &#8220;I intended <i>to have written</i> a letter yesterday:&#8221; say, <i>to write</i>; as
however long it now is since I thought of writing, &#8220;<i>to write</i>&#8221; was then
present to me, and must still be considered as present, when I recall that
time and the thoughts of it.</p>

<p>92. <i>Superfluous R&#8217;s</i>: Many persons pronounce words which have no letter
<i>r</i> in them, exactly as though they had; as <i>drawring</i> for <i>drawing</i>; &#8220;I
<i>sawr</i> Thomas,&#8221; for &#8220;I <i>saw</i>,&#8221; &amp;c. Some who do not insert a full-toned
<i>r</i>, do worse by appending an <i>ah</i> to almost every word they utter. They
would do well to recall the reproof which the excellent Rev. John Gruber
administered to a brother in the ministry, who was guilty of this habit.
That eccentric clergyman addressed a note to his friend, as follows:
&#8220;Dear-ah Sir-ah&mdash;When-ah you-ah speak-ah in-ah public-ah, take-ah my-ah
ad-ah-vice-ah and-ah never-ah say-ah <i>ah-ah</i>!&mdash;<span class="smcap">John-ah Gruber-ah.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>93. <i>Shall</i> and <i>will</i> are often confounded, or misused. The following
suggestion will be of service to the reader: mere <i>futurity</i> is expressed
by <i>shall</i> in the <i>first</i> person, and by <i>will</i> in the <i>second</i> and
<i>third</i>; the <i>determination</i> of the speaker by <i>will</i>, in the <i>first</i>, and
<i>shall</i>, in the <i>second</i> and <i>third</i>. For example: &#8220;<i>I shall go by the way
of Halifax</i>,&#8221; simply expresses an event about to take place&mdash;as also <i>you
will</i>, and <i>they will</i>: <i>I will</i> expresses determination&mdash;as also <i>you
shall</i> and <i>they shall</i>. Brightland has the following illustrative stanza:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;In the first person simply <i>shall</i> foretells;<br />
In <i>will</i> a threat, or else a promise, dwells.<br />
<i>Shall</i>, in the second and the third, does threat;&mdash;<br />
<i>Will</i>, simply, then, foretells the future feat.&#8221;</p>

<p>94. &#8220;<i>Without</i> the grammatical form of a word can be recognized at a
glance, little progress can be made in reading the language:&#8221; [from a work
on the study of the Latin language:] say, <i>Unless</i> the grammatical, &amp;c.
The use of <i>without</i> for <i>unless</i> is a very common mistake.</p>

<p>95. &#8220;He claimed admission to the <i>chiefest</i> offices:&#8221; say, <i>chief</i>.
<i>Chief</i>, <i>right</i>, <i>supreme</i>, <i>correct</i>, <i>true</i>, <i>universal</i>, <i>perfect</i>,
<i>consummate</i>, <i>extreme</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, <i>imply</i> the superlative degree without
adding <i>est</i>, or prefixing <i>most</i>. In language sublime or impassioned,
however, the word <i>perfect</i> requires the superlative form, to give it its
fullest effect.</p>

<p>96. &#8220;I <i>had rather do</i> it now:&#8221; say, I <i>would rather do</i>. The
incorrectness of the first form of expression is very clearly seen by
cutting out <i>rather</i>, leaving &#8220;<i>I had do</i>,&#8221; which is ungrammatical and
meaningless.</p>

<p>97. An obituary notice contained the following ludicrous statement: &#8220;He
left a large circle of mourners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> <i>embracing his amiable wife and
children</i>!&#8221; <i>Comprising</i> should have been used, instead of <i>embracing</i>.</p>

<p>98. &#8220;His <i>court-of-arms</i> is very splendid:&#8221; say, <i>coat-of-arms</i>.</p>

<p>99. &#8220;They ride about in small carriages, which are called <i>flies</i>:&#8221; write
the last word <i>flys</i>; <i>flies</i> is the plural of <i>fly</i>, the insect.</p>

<p>100. &#8220;Victoria is Queen of the <i>United Kingdom</i>:&#8221; say, <i>United Kingdoms</i>.
Who ever speaks of the <i>United State of America</i>?</p>

<p>101. &#8220;I have not traveled <i>this twenty years</i>:&#8221; say, <i>these twenty years</i>.</p>

<p>102. &#8220;Soldier arms!&#8221; Say, &#8220;<i>Shoulder arms!</i>&#8221; The latter is frequently
corrupted into &#8220;<i>Sojer arms!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>103. &#8220;He is <i>very much the gentleman</i>:&#8221; say, He is <i>a very gentlemanly
man</i>, or, <i>He is very gentlemanly</i>.</p>

<p>104. &#8220;The <i>yellow</i> part of an egg is very nourishing:&#8221; never pronounce
<i>yellow</i> so as to rhyme with <i>tallow</i>, as we so often hear.</p>

<p>105. &#8220;We are going to the <i>Zoological</i> Gardens:&#8221; pronounce <i>Zoological</i> in
<i>five</i> syllables, and place the accent on <i>log</i> in <i>logical</i>; sound <i>log</i>
like <i>lodge</i>, and <i>the first two o&#8217;s in distinct syllables</i>; <i>never</i> make
<i>Zool one</i> syllable.</p>

<p>106. &#8220;He <i>strived</i> to obtain an appointment:&#8221; say, <i>strove</i>.</p>

<p>107. &#8220;He always preaches <i>extempore</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>extempore in four
syllables</i>, with the accent on <i>tem</i>, and <i>never in three</i>, making <i>pore</i>
to rhyme with <i>sore</i>&mdash;but with <i>story</i>.</p>

<p>108. &#8220;Allow me to <i>suggest</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>sug</i> as to rhyme with <i>mug</i>, and
<i>gest</i> like <i>jest</i>; never say <i>sudjest</i>.</p>

<p>109. &#8220;That building is an <i>episcopal</i> chapel:&#8221; pronounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> <i>episcopal</i> with
the accent on the second syllable, and <i>not</i> on <i>co</i>.</p>

<p>110. &#8220;The Emperor of Russia is a <i>formidable</i> sovereign:&#8221; pronounce
<i>formidable</i> with the accent on <i>for</i>, and <i>not on mid</i>.</p>

<p>111. Before the words <i>heir</i>, <i>herb</i>, <i>honest</i>, <i>honor</i>, and <i>hour</i>, and
their compounds, instead of the article <i>a</i>, we make use of <i>an</i>, as the
<i>h</i> is not sounded; likewise before words beginning with <i>h</i>, that are not
accented on the first syllable: such as <i>heroic</i>, <i>historical</i>,
<i>hypothesis</i>, &amp;c., as, &#8220;<i>an heroic action</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>an historical work</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>an
hypothesis</i> that can scarcely be allowed.&#8221; The letter <i>h</i> is seldom mute
at the beginning of a word; but from the negligence of tutors, and the
inattention of pupils, many persons have become almost incapable of
acquiring its just and full pronunciation. It is, therefore, incumbent on
teachers to be particularly careful to inculcate a clear and distinct
utterance of this sound.</p>

<p>112. &#8220;He was <i>such an extravagant young man</i>, that he soon spent his whole
patrimony.&#8221; This construction, which is much used, is not so elegant as,
&#8220;He was <i>so extravagant a young man</i>,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>113. &#8220;The girl speaks <i>distinct</i>:&#8221; say, <i>distinctly</i>. <i>Never use
Adjectives as Adverbs.</i></p>

<p>114. &#8220;The accident of which he was <i>reading</i>, occurred not far from
<i>Reading</i>:&#8221; pronounced the first italicized word to rhyme with <i>feeding</i>,
and the other, with <i>wedding</i>.</p>

<p>115. The combination of letters <i>ough</i> is pronounced in eight different
ways, as follows: 1. Th<i>ough</i>, in which it is pronounced <i>o</i>; 2.
Thr<i>ough</i>, pronounced <i>oo</i>; 3. Pl<i>ough</i>, <i>ow</i>; 4. S<i>ought</i>, <i>awe</i>; 5.
C<i>ough</i>, <i>off</i>; 6. R<i>ough</i>, <i>uff</i>; 7. Bor<i>ough</i>, <i>ugh</i>; 8. L<i>ough</i>, <i>ok</i>.
The following sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> which is of doubtful authorship, affords an
example of each of these eight modes of pronunciation: &#8220;I put (1) <i>dough</i>
(6) <i>enough</i> in the (5) <i>trough</i> near the (3) <i>slough</i> by the (8) <i>lough</i>,
to last the ducks that I (4) <i>bought</i> at the (7) <i>borough</i> (2) <i>through</i> the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>116. &#8220;I saw his <i>august</i> majesty, the Emperor of Hayti, last <i>August</i>:&#8221;
pronounce the former word with the accent on <i>gust</i>; the latter, on <i>Au</i>.</p>

<p>117. &#8220;She is <i>quite the lady</i>:&#8221; say, She is <i>very lady-like in her demeanor</i>.</p>

<p>118. &#8220;He is <i>seldom or ever</i> out of town:&#8221; say, <i>seldom or never</i>, or, <i>seldom if ever</i>.</p>

<p>119. &#8220;We <i>laid down</i> to sleep:&#8221; say, we <i>lay down</i>, &amp;c. We can say,
however, &#8220;we laid <i>him</i> down to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>120. It is somewhat singular, that while <i>tie</i> and <i>untie</i> convey meanings
directly opposite, <i>loose</i> and <i>unloose</i> signify precisely the same thing.
<i>Loose</i> is the original word, and <i>unloose</i> is a corruption; both words,
however, are now sanctioned by good usage, and may be indiscriminately
employed, without offence against propriety.</p>

<p>121. &#8220;It is dangerous to walk <i>of a</i> slippery morning:&#8221; say, <i>on a</i>
slippery morning. But the expression, &#8220;<i>walking on a slippery morning</i>,&#8221;
and all others like it, of which a strictly literal interpretation will
not give the designed signification, are to be avoided. They often excite
a smile when seriousness is intended.</p>

<p>122. &#8220;He who makes himself famous by his eloquence, makes illustrious his
origin, let it be <i>never so mean</i>:&#8221; say, <i>ever so mean</i>. The practice of
using <i>never</i> in such phrases was anciently in vogue, but is now becoming
obsolete. (See Introduction.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>123. &#8220;His reputation is acknowledged <i>through</i> Europe:&#8221; say, <i>throughout</i>
Europe.</p>

<p>124. &#8220;The bank of the river is frequently <i>overflown</i>:&#8221; say, <i>overflowed</i>.
<i>Flown</i> is the perfect participle of <i>fly, flying</i>; <i>flowed</i>, of <i>flow,
flowing</i>.</p>

<p>125. &#8220;I doubt <i>if this</i> will ever reach you:&#8221; say, <i>whether this</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>126. &#8220;It is not improbable <i>but I may</i> be able to procure you a copy:&#8221;
say, <i>that I may</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>127. &#8220;He was <i>exceeding kind</i> to me:&#8221; say, <i>exceedingly kind</i>.</p>

<p>128. &#8220;I doubt not <i>but I shall</i> be able:&#8221; say, <i>that I shall</i>.</p>

<p>129. &#8220;I lost <i>near</i> twenty pounds:&#8221; say, <i>nearly</i>, or <i>almost</i>.</p>

<p>130. &#8220;There were not <i>over</i> twenty persons present:&#8221; say, <i>more than</i>.
Such a use of this word is not frequent among writers of reputation. It
may, however, be less improperly employed, where the sense invests it with
more of a semblance to its literal signification: as, &#8220;This pair of
chickens will weigh <i>over</i> seven pounds.&#8221; Even in this case, it is better
to say <i>more than</i>.</p>

<p>131. &#8220;<i>Bills are requested to be paid quarterly</i>:&#8221; <i>the bills are not
requested</i>, but <i>the persons who owe them</i>. Say instead, <i>It is requested
that bills be paid quarterly</i>.</p>

<p>132. &#8220;There can be no doubt <i>but that</i> he will succeed:&#8221; omit <i>but</i>.</p>

<p>133. &#8220;It was <i>no use asking</i> him any more questions:&#8221; say, <i>of no use to
ask him</i>, or <i>there was no use in asking</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>134. &#8220;The Americans said they <i>had no right</i> to pay taxes.&#8221; [From a Fourth
of July Oration.] They certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> <i>had a right</i> to pay them, if they
wished. What the speaker meant was, <i>they were under no obligation to
pay</i>, or, <i>they were not bound to pay</i>.</p>

<p>135. &#8220;He intends to <i>stop</i> at home for a few days:&#8221; it is more elegant to
say <i>stay</i>. If the time, however, should be very brief, <i>stop</i> would
better express the idea; as, &#8220;We <i>stopped</i> at Elmira about twenty
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>136. &#8220;At this time, I <i>grew</i> my own corn:&#8221; say, I <i>raised</i>. Farmers have
made this innovation against good taste; but for what reason, it is not
apparent; there seems to be no sufficient occasion for so awkward a
substitute for <i>raised</i>.</p>

<p>137. &#8220;Having incautiously <i>laid down</i> on the damp grass, he caught a
severe cold:&#8221; say, <i>lain down</i>.</p>

<p>138. &#8220;We suffered no other inconvenience <i>but</i> that arising from the
rain:&#8221; say, <i>than</i> that, &amp;c. <i>But</i>, to be properly used in this sentence,
would require the omission of <i>other</i>.</p>

<p>139. &#8220;Brutus and Aruns killed <i>one another</i>:&#8221; say, <i>each other</i>, which is
more proper. But many similar instances which occur in the New Testament,
as, &#8220;<i>Beloved, love one another</i>,&#8221; and others no less beautiful and
cherished, have rendered this form of expression common, and almost
unexceptionable.</p>

<p>140. In a recently issued work on Arithmetic, the following is given: &#8220;If
for 72 cents I can buy 9 lbs. of raisins, <i>how much</i> can I purchase for
$14 49?&#8221; say, &#8220;<i>what quantity</i> can I,&#8221; &amp;c. Who would think of saying,
&#8220;<i>how much raisins?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>141. <span class="smcap">Words to be Carefully Distinguished.</span>&mdash;Be very careful to distinguish
between <i>indite</i> and <i>indict</i> (the former meaning <i>to write</i>, and the
latter <i>to accuse</i>); <i>key</i> and <i>quay</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> <i>principle</i> and <i>principal</i>;

<i>satire</i> and <i>satyr</i>; <i>stationery</i> and <i>stationary</i>; <i>ton</i> and <i>tun</i>;
<i>levy</i> and <i>levee</i>; <i>foment</i> and <i>ferment</i>; <i>fomentation</i> and
<i>fermentation</i>; <i>petition</i> and <i>partition</i>; <i>Francis</i> and <i>Frances</i>;
<i>dose</i> and <i>doze</i>; <i>diverse</i> and <i>divers</i>; <i>device</i> and <i>devise</i>; <i>wary</i>
and <i>weary</i>; <i>salary</i> and <i>celery</i>; <i>radish</i> and <i>reddish</i>; <i>treble</i> and
<i>triple</i>; <i>broach</i> and <i>brooch</i>; <i>ingenious</i> and <i>ingenuous</i>; <i>prophesy</i>
and <i>prophecy</i> (some clergymen sounding the final syllable of the latter
word <i>long</i>, like the former); <i>fondling</i> and <i>foundling</i>; <i>lightning</i> and
<i>lightening</i>; <i>genus</i> and <i>genius</i>; <i>desert</i> and <i>dessert</i>; <i>currier</i> and
<i>courier</i>; <i>pillow</i> and <i>pillar</i>; <i>executer</i> and <i>executor</i> (the former
being the regular noun from the verb &#8220;to <i>execute</i>,&#8221; and the latter a
strictly <i>legal</i> term); <i>ridicule</i> and <i>reticule</i>; <i>lineament</i> and
<i>liniment</i>; <i>track</i> and <i>tract</i>, <i>lickerish</i> and <i>licorice</i> (<i>lickerish</i>
signifying <i>dainty</i>, and <i>licorice</i> being a plant, or preparation from
it); <i>statute</i> and <i>statue</i>; <i>ordinance</i> and <i>ordnance</i>; <i>lease</i> and
<i>leash</i>; <i>recourse</i> and <i>resource</i>; <i>straight</i> and <i>strait</i> (<i>straight</i>
meaning <i>direct</i>, and <i>strait</i>, <i>narrow</i>); <i>immerge</i> and <i>emerge</i>; <i>style</i>
and <i>stile</i>; <i>compliment</i> and <i>complement</i>; <i>bass</i> and <i>base</i>;
<i>contagious</i> and <i>contiguous</i>; <i>eminent</i> and <i>imminent</i>; <i>eruption</i> and
<i>irruption</i>; <i>precedent</i> and <i>president</i>; <i>relic</i> and <i>relict</i>.</p>

<p>142. &#8220;The number of <i>emigrants</i> arriving in this country is increasing and
alarming:&#8221; say, <i>immigrants</i>. <i>Emigrants</i> are those <i>going out</i> from a
country; <i>immigrants</i>, those <i>coming into</i> it.</p>

<p>143. &#8220;I prefer <i>radishes</i> to <i>cucumbers</i>:&#8221; pronounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> <i>radishes</i> exactly
as spelt, and not <i>redishes</i>; also, the first syllable of <i>cucumber</i> like
<i>fu</i> in <i>fuel</i>, and not as if the word were spelled <i>cowcumber</i>.</p>

<p>144. &#8220;The <i>two last</i> letters were dated from Calcutta:&#8221; say, the <i>last
two</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>145. &#8220;The soil in those islands is so very thin, that little is produced
in them <i>beside</i> cocoa-nut trees:&#8221; &#8220;<i>beside</i> cocoa-nut trees&#8221; means
strictly <i>alongside</i>, or <i>by the side</i>, of them. <i>Besides</i>, or <i>except</i>,
should be used. <i>Besides</i> also signifies <i>in addition to</i>: as, &#8220;I sat
<i>beside</i> the President, and conversed with him <i>besides</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>146. &#8220;He could neither <i>read nor write</i>:&#8221; say, more properly, <i>write nor
read</i>. All persons who can <i>write</i> can <i>read</i>, but not all who <i>read</i> can
<i>write</i>. This sentence, as corrected, is much stronger than in the other
form.</p>

<p>147. &#8220;He was <i>bred and born</i> among the hills of the Hudson:&#8221; say, <i>born
and bred</i>, which is the natural order.</p>

<p>148. &#8220;<span class="smcap">This House To Let</span>:&#8221; more properly, <i>to be let</i>.</p>

<p>149. <i>Here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>where</i>, with verbs of motion, are generally better
than <i>hither</i>, <i>thither</i>, <i>whither</i>; as, &#8220;<i>Come here</i>; <i>Go there</i>.&#8221;
<i>Hither</i>, <i>thither</i>, and <i>whither</i>, which were used formerly, are now
considered stiff and inelegant.</p>

<p>150. &#8220;<i>As far as I</i> am able to judge, the book is well written:&#8221; say, <i>So
far as</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>151. &#8220;It is doubtful whether he will act <i>fairly or no</i>:&#8221; say, <i>fairly or
not</i>.</p>

<p>152. &#8220;The <i>camelopard</i> is the tallest of known animals:&#8221; pronounce
<i>camelopard</i> with the accent on <i>mel</i>; never say <i>camel leopard</i>. Few
words, by being mispronounced, occasion greater blunders than this term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>153. &#8220;He ran <i>again</i> me;&#8221; or, &#8220;I stood <i>again</i> the hydrant:&#8221; say,
<i>against</i>. This word is frequently and inelegantly abbreviated, in
pronunciation, into <i>agin</i>.</p>

<p>154. &#8220;<i>No one</i> should incur censure for being careful of <i>their</i> good
character:&#8221; say, of <i>his</i> (or <i>her</i>).</p>

<p>155. &#8220;The yacht capsized in rounding the stake-boat, and the helmsman was
<i>drownded</i>:&#8221; say, <i>drowned</i>.</p>

<p>156. &#8220;<i>Jalap</i> will be of service to you:&#8221; pronounce the word as it is
spelled, never saying <i>jollop</i>.</p>

<p>157. The word <i>curiosity</i>, though a very common term, and one that should
be correctly pronounced by everybody, is frequently called <i>curosity</i>.</p>

<p>158. &#8220;He has just set out to <i>take a tour</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>tour</i> so as to
rhyme with <i>poor</i>. Be careful to avoid saying, <i>take a tower</i>; such a
pronunciation might suggest the Mamelon, instead of a trip of travel.</p>

<p>159. &#8220;The storm <i>is</i> ceased, and the sky is clear:&#8221; say, <i>has</i> ceased.</p>

<p>160. &#8220;Do you know <i>who</i> this dog-headed cane belongs to?&#8221; say, <i>whom</i>. In
expressing in <i>writing</i> the idea conveyed in this question, a better form
of sentence would be, &#8220;Do you know <i>to whom</i> this belongs?&#8221; In familiar
conversation, however, the latter mode might be thought too formal and
precise.</p>

<p>161. &#8220;<i>Who</i> did you wish to see?&#8221; say, <i>whom</i>.</p>

<p>162. &#8220;<i>Whom</i> say ye that I am?&#8221; This is the English translation, given in
Luke ix. 20, of the question of Christ to Peter. The word <i>whom</i> should be
<i>who</i>. Other instances of grammatical inaccuracies occur in the Bible; for
example, in the Sermon on the Mount, the Saviour says: &#8220;Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> where <i>moth and rust doth corrupt</i>,&#8221; &amp;c.
&#8220;<i>Moth and rust</i>&#8221; make a plural nominative to &#8220;<i>doth</i> corrupt,&#8221; a singular
verb. The following, however, is correct: &#8220;But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where <i>neither moth nor rust doth corrupt</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>163. The word <i>chimney</i> is sometimes called incorrectly <i>chimley</i> and
<i>chimbley</i>.</p>

<p>164. &#8220;I was walking <i>towards</i> home:&#8221; pronounce <i>towards</i> so as to rhyme
with <i>boards</i>; <i>never</i> say, <i>to-wards</i>.</p>

<p>165. &#8220;A <i>courier</i> is expected from Washington:&#8221; pronounce <i>cou</i> in
<i>courier</i> so as to rhyme with <i>too</i>, never like <i>currier</i>; the two words
have entirely distinct significations.</p>

<p>166. &#8220;Let each of us mind <i>their</i> own business:&#8221; say, <i>his</i> own business.</p>

<p>167. &#8220;Who made that noise? Not <i>me</i>:&#8221; say, Not <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>168. &#8220;Is this or that the <i>best</i> road?&#8221; say, the <i>better</i> road.</p>

<p>169. &#8220;<i>Rinse</i> your mouth:&#8221; pronounce <i>rinse</i> as it is written, and never
<i>rense</i>. &#8220;<i>Rench your mouth</i>,&#8221; said a fashionable dentist one day to a
patient. &#8220;You have already <i>wrenched it for me</i>,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>170. &#8220;He was tired of the dust of the town, and <i>flew</i> to the pure air of
the country:&#8221; say, <i>fled</i>. <i>Flew</i> is part of the verb <i>to fly</i>; <i>fled</i>, of
<i>to flee</i>.</p>

<p>171. &#8220;The first edition was not <i>as</i> well printed as the present:&#8221; say,
<i>so</i> well, &amp;c.</p>

<p>172. &#8220;The Unabridged Dictionary was his greatest work, it being the labor
of a life-time:&#8221; pronounce <i>Dictionary</i> as if written <i>Dik-shun-a-ry</i>;
not, as is too commonly the practice, <i>Dixonary</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>173. &#8220;I should feel sorry to be <i>beholding</i> to him:&#8221; say, <i>beholden</i>.</p>

<p>174. &#8220;He is a <i>despicable</i> fellow, and such an epitaph is strictly
<i>applicable</i> to him:&#8221; <i>never</i> place the accent in <i>despicable</i> and
<i>applicable</i> on the <i>second</i> syllable, but <i>always</i> on the <i>first</i>.</p>

<p>175. &#8220;Some disaster has certainly <i>befell</i> him:&#8221; say, <i>befallen</i>.</p>

<p>176. Carefully distinguish between <i>sergeant</i> and <i>serjeant</i>: both are
pronounced <i>sarjant</i>, but the <i>former</i> is used in a military sense, and
the <i>latter</i> applied to a lawyer. These distinctions are, however,
observed chiefly in England.</p>

<p>177. &#8220;She is a pretty <i>creature</i>:&#8221; never pronounce <i>creature</i> like
<i>creetur</i>.</p>

<p>178. The following expression would be of special significance on coming
from a surgeon or anatomist: &#8220;Desiring to know your friend better, <i>I took
him apart</i> to converse with him.&#8221; It has been said that two persons who
<i>take each other apart</i>, frequently do so for the express purpose of
<i>putting their heads together</i>.</p>

<p>179. &#8220;I am very wet, and must go and <i>change myself</i>:&#8221; say, <i>change my
clothes</i>.</p>

<p>180. &#8220;He is taller <i>than me</i>:&#8221; say, <i>than I</i>.</p>

<p>181. &#8220;He is much better <i>than me</i>:&#8221; say, <i>than I</i>.</p>

<p>182. &#8220;You are stronger <i>than him</i>:&#8221; say, <i>than he</i>.</p>

<p>183. &#8220;That is the <i>moot</i> point:&#8221; say, <i>disputed</i> point. The other word is
inelegant, and nearly obsolete.</p>

<p>184. &#8220;They are at <i>loggerheads</i>&#8221;: this is an extremely unpoetical figure
to express the mutual relations of two individuals who have an &#8220;honest
difference;&#8221; say, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> <i>variance</i>, or use some other form of expression. It
might just as well be said, &#8220;They are at <i>tadpoles</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>185. &#8220;He paid a <i>florin</i> to the <i>florist</i>:&#8221; divide the syllables so as to
pronounce like <i>flor-in</i> and <i>flo-rist</i>.</p>

<p>186. &#8220;His character is <i>undeniable</i>:&#8221; a very common expression: say,
<i>unexceptionable</i>.</p>

<p>187. &#8220;Bring me the <i>lantern</i>:&#8221; never spell <i>lantern</i>&mdash;<i>lanthorn</i>.</p>

<p>188. &#8220;The room is twelve <i>foot</i> long, and nine <i>foot</i> broad:&#8221; say, twelve
<i>feet</i>, nine <i>feet</i>.</p>

<p>189. &#8220;He is a <i>Highlander</i>:&#8221; never say, <i>Heelander</i>.</p>

<p>190. &#8220;He is <i>singular</i>, though <i>regular</i> in his habits, and also very
<i>particular</i>:&#8221; beware of leaving out the <i>u</i> in <i>singular</i>, <i>regular</i>, and
<i>particular</i>, which is a very common practice.</p>

<p>191. &#8220;They are detained <i>at</i> France:&#8221; say, <i>in</i> France.</p>

<p>192. &#8220;He lives <i>at</i> New-York:&#8221; say, <i>in</i> New-York.</p>

<p>193. &#8220;He is very <i>dry</i>&#8221; (meaning <i>thirsty</i>), is a very common and very
improper word to use: say, <i>thirsty</i>.</p>

<p>194. &#8220;No <i>less</i> than fifty persons were there:&#8221; say, <i>fewer</i>, &amp;c. <i>Less</i>

and pronounced <i>holyday</i>, being compounded of the two words <i>holy</i>
(meaning &#8220;<i>set apart</i>&#8221;) and <i>day</i>. Custom, however, has changed the
orthography from <i>y</i> to <i>i</i>, and made the first syllable rhyme with
<i>Poll</i>.</p>

second, not the first syllable.</p>

<i>Wooster</i>. <i>Gloucester</i> and <i>Leicester</i> are pronounced <i>Gloster</i> and
<i>Lester</i>. The termination <i>cester</i> or <i>chester</i>, occurring in the names of
many English towns, is derived and corrupted from the Latin <i>Castra</i>,
camps; and every town so named is supposed to have been the site of a camp
of soldiers, during the possession of Britain by the Romans.</p>

<p>232. &#8220;What a long <i>lirry</i> he has to say!&#8221; This word should be pronounced
and spelt <i>lurry</i>; its more general meaning is a &#8220;heap,&#8221; a &#8220;throng,&#8221; a
&#8220;crowd,&#8221; but is often applied to a long dull speech.</p>

<p>235. &#8220;Do you <i>believe</i> that he will <i>receive</i> my letter?&#8221; observe that in
the former word the diphthong is <i>ie</i>, and in the latter <i>ei</i>. A

<i>ei</i> after it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> all other consonants are followed by <i>ie</i>:&mdash;as, dec<i>ei</i>ve,
repr<i>ie</i>ve.</p>

syllables like the word <i>nation</i>, never as if written <i>nash-ion-al</i>.</p>

between these words. <i>Principal</i> signifies <i>chief</i>; <i>principle</i>, <i>motive</i>.</p>

<p>239. &#8220;He favors the <i>Anti-Slavery</i> reform:&#8221; pronounce <i>Anti</i> with a
distinct sounding of the <i>i</i>; else the word becomes <i>ante</i>, which means
not &#8220;against,&#8221; but &#8220;before,&#8221;&mdash;as &#8220;ante-deluvian,&#8221; signifying &#8220;before the
Deluge.&#8221;</p>

<p>240. <i>Cincinnati</i> is often misspelled <i>Cincinnatti</i>. The name is derived
from <i>Cincinnatus</i>, a celebrated Roman.</p>

<p>241. &#8220;Her dress was made of <i>moir&eacute; antique</i>:&#8221; <i>moir&eacute; antique</i> is an
article of <i>watered silk</i>, very well known to the &#8220;shopping&#8221; sisterhood,
but very frequently called &#8220;<i>Murray Antique</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>242. &#8220;It was mentioned in a <i>Californian newspaper</i>:&#8221; say, <i>California</i>

account, in a New-York newspaper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> of the Submarine Telegraph Expedition,
September, 1855.] Does it mean that St. John&#8217;s is nearer to England than
Halifax is, or nearer to England than to Halifax?</p>

<p>247. &#8220;He wears a blue-spotted <i>neck-handkerchief</i>:&#8221; say, <i>neckerchief</i>,
or, still better, <i>neck-cloth</i>, or <i>cravat</i>. The original word is

<p>248. &#8220;The city was <i>illumined</i> in honor of the victory:&#8221; better say,

<i>lucky</i> and <i>luckily</i>, imply only <i>good fortune</i>.</p>

<p>251. &#8220;The <i>in-va-lid</i> signed a deed, that was <i>in-val-id</i>:&#8221; pronounce the
former &#8220;<i>invalid</i>&#8221; with the accent on the <i>first</i> syllable; the <i>latter</i>,
with the accent on the <i>second</i>.</p>

<p>252. &#8220;The <i>duke</i> discharged his <i>duty</i>.&#8221; Be careful to give the slender,
clear sound of <i>u</i>. Avoid saying <i>dook</i> and <i>dooty</i>, or <i>doo</i> for <i>dew</i> or
<i>due</i>. Say <i>flute</i>, not <i>floot</i>; <i>suit</i>, not <i>soot</i>; <i>mute</i>, not <i>moot</i>.
As well might you say <i>bute</i> for <i>boot</i>, or <i>shute</i> for shoot.</p>

<p>253. &#8220;<i>Genealogy</i>, <i>geography</i>, and <i>geometry</i> are words of Greek
derivation:&#8221; beware of saying <i>geneology</i>, <i>jography</i>, and <i>jometry</i>, a

<p>265. &#8220;<i>We have never been called, almost, to the consideration</i> of the
Apocalypse, without finding fresh reasons for our opinion.&#8221; [Such are the
words of a very eminent reviewer.] He should have said, &#8220;We have <i>scarcely

<p>270. &#8220;He is a distinguished <i>antiquarian</i>:&#8221; say, <i>antiquary</i>.
<i>Antiquarian</i> is an adjective; <i>antiquary</i>, a noun.</p>

<p>271. An injudicious disposition of a clause in a sentence frequently
creates great merriment in the reading. In Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;History of
England,&#8221; a book remarkable for its carelessness of style, we find the
following extraordinary sentence, in one of the chapters of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth: &#8220;This&#8221; [a communication to Mary Queen of Scots] &#8220;they
effected by conveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that
<i>supplied the family with ale through a chink in the wall of her
apartment</i>.&#8221; A queer brewer that&mdash;to supply ale through a chink in the
wall! How easy the alteration to make the passage clear! &#8220;This they
effected by conveying their letters to her <i>through a chink in the wall of
her apartment, by means of a brewer that supplied the family with ale</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>272. &#8220;Lavater wrote on <i>Physiognomy</i>:&#8221; in the last word sound the <i>g</i>
distinctly, as <i>g</i> is always pronounced before <i>n</i>, when it is not in the
same syllable; as, <i>indignity</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>273. &#8220;She is a very amiable <i>girl</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>girl</i> as if written
<i>gurl</i>; <i>gal</i> is a vulgarism; <i>gehl</i> or <i>gul</i> is an affectation of which
many polite persons are guilty.</p>

<p>274. &#8220;He built a large <i>granary</i>:&#8221; <i>do not</i> pronounce <i>granary</i> so as to
rhyme with <i>tannery</i>. Call the word <i>grainary</i>. Both pronunciations,
however, are given by scholars.</p>

<p>275. Beware of using <i>Oh!</i> and <i>O</i> indiscriminately: <i>Oh!</i> is used to
express the emotion of <i>pain</i>, <i>sorrow</i>, or <i>surprise</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> as, &#8220;<i>Oh!</i> the
exceeding grace of God.&#8221; <i>O</i> is used to express <i>wishing</i>, <i>exclamation</i>,

or a direct <i>address</i> to a person; as,</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;O mother, will the God above<br />
Forgive my faults like thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>276. Be careful to sound distinctly the <i>r</i> in such words as <i>farther</i>,
<i>martyr</i>, <i>charter</i>, <i>murder</i>, &amp;c. Never say, <i>fah-ther</i>, <i>mah-tyr</i>,
<i>chah-ter</i> and <i>muh-der</i>. On the other hand, avoid <i>trilling</i> the <i>r</i>, as
<i>mur-er-der</i>, <i>r'r'robber</i>. It is altogether too tragical for common life.</p>

<p>277. &#8220;The Duke of Wellington was an <i>Irishman</i>, but knew nothing of the
<i>Irish</i> language:&#8221; beware of saying <i>Ierishman</i> for <i>Irishman</i>, or
<i>Ierish</i> for <i>Irish</i>; a very common mistake, which the &#8220;Know-Nothings&#8221; are
quick to detect.</p>

<p>278. &#8220;He did it <i>unbeknown</i> to us:&#8221; say, <i>unknown</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>279. &#8220;He lives in <i>affluence</i>, as he is in <i>affluent</i> circumstances:&#8221;
beware of placing the accent in <i>affluence</i> and <i>affluent</i> on the syllable
<i>flu</i> instead of on <i>af</i>, a very common error.</p>

<p>280. &#8220;If I say, &#8216;They retreated <i>back</i>,&#8217; I use a word that is
<i>superfluous</i>, as <i>back</i> is implied in the syllable <i>re</i> in <i>retreated</i>:&#8221;
never place the accent on <i>flu</i> in <i>superfluous</i>, but always on <i>per</i>.</p>

<p>281. &#8220;In reading Paley&#8217;s &#8216;Evidences of Christianity,&#8217; I unexpectedly <i>lit
on</i> the passage I wanted:&#8221; say, <i>met with</i> the passage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>282. A gentleman having selected a book from the library shelves of the
Mechanics&#8217; Institute, went to the librarian to have the volume registered
under his name, and said, &#8220;<i>I have taken the life of Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.&#8221; &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
shall then,&#8221; responded the librarian, &#8220;charge the work to Mr. Brutus!&#8221; Be
careful how you &#8220;take the lives&#8221; of distinguished men.</p>

<p>283. &#8220;He has a <i>bayonet</i> to his gun:&#8221; never say <i>baggonet</i>. This error is
a peculiarity of the Wiltshire dialect, in England. In an old Wiltshire
song the following stanza occurs:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;A hornet zet in a holler tree,<br />
A proper spiteful twoad was he;<br />
And merrily zung while he did zet,&mdash;<br />
His sting as sharp as a <i>baggonet</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>284. &#8220;Aunt Deborah is down with the <i>rheumatiz</i>:&#8221; say, <i>rheumatism</i>; this

<p>285. &#8220;It is <i>obligatory</i> upon every honest man to go to the polls to-day:&#8221;
accent <i>lig</i>, and not <i>ga</i>.</p>

<p>286. &#8220;On the <i>contrary</i>:&#8221; accent <i>con</i>, not <i>tra</i>. The old song takes up
with a bad pronunciation, for the sake of a good rhyme:</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;Mistress Mary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quite <i>contrary</i>,</span><br />
How does your garden grow?&#8221;</p>

<p>287. &#8220;That is altogether <i>above my bend</i>:&#8221; say, <i>out of my power</i>.</p>

<p>288. &#8220;He has <i>absquatulated</i>, and taken the specie with him:&#8221; <i>absconded</i>

<p>290. &#8220;<i>I haven&#8217;t ary one</i>:&#8221; say, <i>I have neither</i>, or, <i>I haven&#8217;t either</i>.</p>

<i>situation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>292. It may be doubted whether to say of a man &#8220;that <i>he barked up the
wrong tree</i>,&#8221; is a complimentary or elegant metaphor.</p>

<i>remainder</i>.</p>

<p>294. &#8220;I <i>calculate</i> to go by steam:&#8221; say, &#8220;I <i>expect</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>295. Avoid using the phrase &#8220;<i>I cave in</i>,&#8221; for &#8220;<i>I give up</i>.&#8221; It savors of slang.</p>

<p>296. Do not say, &#8220;<i>chicken fixings</i>,&#8221; for &#8220;<i>trifles</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>extras</i>,&#8221; connected with dress.</p>

<p>297. &#8220;He is a <i>cute</i> man:&#8221; this is an inelegant abbreviation of <i>acute</i>,
and employed to mean <i>smart</i>. It may, however, be properly applied to Yankees!</p>

<p>298. &#8220;He <i>dickered</i> with him an hour:&#8221; say, &#8220;he <i>bargained</i>.&#8221; This is a

<p>302. &#8220;It rains, and I want an umbrella <i>the worst kind</i>:&#8221; say, &#8220;<i>I am
greatly in want</i>,&#8221; &amp;c. An umbrella <i>of the worst kind</i> would not be likely
to answer the best of purposes on a rainy day!</p>

<p>310. &#8220;It is new <i>China ware</i>:&#8221; do not say, <i>chaney ware</i>; this latter
article exists only in the traditions of old women.</p>

or <i>boggy</i>, is now obsolete, and cannot be used with propriety.</p>

<p>319. &#8220;He talks <i>pulpitically</i>:&#8221; this word, which some who copy
Chesterfield persist in using, has never by any good authority been

useable word.</p>

<p>321. Be careful to distinguish between <i>pencil</i>, an instrument for

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>322. <i>To yank</i> is a vulgarism, meaning <i>to twitch powerfully</i>.</p>

<p>328. &#8220;The basket is <i>pretty large</i>:&#8221; avoid, if possible, the use of the

with substitutes more elegant.</p>

<p>332. &#8220;<i>To flunk out</i>&#8221; is a vulgar expression for <i>to retire through fear</i>;

<p>333. &#8220;When last observed, he was <i>going at full chisel</i>:&#8221; say, <i>at the top
of his speed</i>.</p>

<p>334. &#8220;That bill is a <i>counterfeit</i>:&#8221; the last syllable is pronounced as if
written <i>fit</i>, and not <i>feet</i>.</p>

<p>335. &#8220;I am very much <i>obliged</i> to you:&#8221; do not say <i>obleeged</i>.</p>

<p>336. The following sentence affords an example of three words of similar
pronunciation, but different signification: &#8220;It is not easy to <i>pare</i> a
<i>pear</i> with a <i>pair</i> of scissors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>337. &#8220;The <i>robber</i> entered the dwelling, and secretly carried off the
silver:&#8221; say, <i>thief</i>; a <i>robber</i> attacks violently, and commits his
depredations by main force; a <i>thief</i> is one who uses secrecy and deception.</p>

<p>338. &#8220;Go and <i>fetch</i> me my riding-whip:&#8221; say, <i>bring</i>. <i>Fetch</i> means to
<i>go and bring</i>; <i>go and fetch</i> is repetition.</p>

<p>339. <i>To leave</i> and <i>to quit</i> are often used as synonymous terms, though
improperly; <i>to leave</i> implies a design of returning soon&mdash;<i>to quit</i>, an
absence of a long time, or forever; as, in Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;the very rats</span><br />
Instinctively had <i>quit</i> it.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, i. 2.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall <i>leave</i> my house for a month before next Autumn; but I shall not
be obliged to <i>quit</i> it until after Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>340. <i>Mute</i> and <i>dumb</i>. A <i>dumb</i> man has not the power to speak; a <i>mute</i>
man either does not choose, or is not allowed to speak. It is, therefore,
more proper to say of a person who can neither hear nor speak, that he is
&#8220;deaf and <i>dumb</i>,&#8221; than that he is a &#8220;deaf <i>mute</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>341. <i>Strong</i> and <i>robust</i>. These words are frequently misused: a <i>strong</i>
man is able to bear a heavy burden, but not necessarily for a long time; a
<i>robust</i> man bears <i>continual</i> fatigue with ease; a <i>strong</i> man may be
active and nimble; while an excess of muscular development, together with
a clumsiness of action, exclude these qualities from the <i>robust</i> man:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;<i>Strong</i> as a tower in hope, I cry Amen!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, <i>Richard II.</i> i. 3.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><br />
&#8220;For one who, though of drooping mien, had yet<br />
From nature&#8217;s kindliness received a frame<br />
<i>Robust</i> as ever rural labor bred.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>, <i>Excursion</i>, VI.</span></p>

<p>342. &#8220;Isaac Newton <i>invented</i> the law of gravitation:&#8221; say, <i>discovered</i>.
&#8220;Galileo <i>discovered</i> the telescope:&#8221; say, <i>invented</i>.</p>

<p>343. To <i>hear</i> and to <i>listen</i> have each distinct degrees of meaning. To
<i>hear</i> implies no effort or particular attention. To <i>listen</i> implies some
eagerness to hear. An old proverb says, &#8220;They that <i>listen</i> seldom <i>hear</i>
any good of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>344. <i>Ought</i> and <i>should</i> both express obligation, but the latter is not
so binding as the former. &#8220;Children <i>ought to</i> love their parents, and
<i>should</i> be neat in their appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>345. <i>Alone</i> and <i>only</i> are often misapplied. &#8220;He <i>only</i> could do it,&#8221;
means that no other but himself could do it; &#8220;he <i>alone</i> could do it,&#8221;
should mean that he, without the assistance of others, could do it.</p>

<p>346. &#8220;Please the pigs.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Old Proverb.</i>) This is a corruption from
&#8220;Please the <i>pyx</i>.&#8221; The <i>pyx</i> is the receptacle which contains the
consecrated wafer on Romish altars; and the exclamation is equal to
&#8220;Please God.&#8221; This corruption is as curious a one as that of &#8220;tawdry&#8221; from
&#8220;&#8217;t Audrey,&#8221; or &#8220;at St. Audrey&#8217;s Fair,&#8221; famous for the sale of
frippery&mdash;showy, cheap, and worthless.</p>

<p>347. &#8220;The <i>partridge</i> is a delightful bird:&#8221; do not say <i>patridge</i>. Also,
do not say <i>pasley</i> for <i>parsley</i>.</p>

<p>348. &#8220;After this, let him hide his <i>diminished head</i>:&#8221; this common phrase
is a poetical quotation from Milton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> and is therefore proper to be used
even when it does not <i>literally</i> express the idea:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;At whose sight all the stars<br />
Hide their <i>diminished heads</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>349. &#8220;That bourne from whence no traveler returns.&#8221; How often are
precisely these words spoken? They are improperly quoted from Shakespeare,
in Hamlet, and correctly read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;That undiscovered country, from whose bourne<br />
No traveler returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>350. &#8220;Bring me my <i>waistcoat</i>:&#8221; pronounce as if written <i>waste-coat</i>, and
not <i>weskut</i>. It should rhyme, as it did in an old ballad, with &#8220;<i>laced
coat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>351. &#8220;Your <i>bonnet</i> to its right use.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Shakespeare:</i>) never say
<i>bunnet</i>.</p>

<p>352. &#8220;It is not cold enough to wear my <i>gloves</i>:&#8221; pronounce as if written
<i>gluvs</i>, and to rhyme with <i>loves</i>. In &#8220;Fair Rosamond&#8221; the following
illustrative stanza occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;He said he had his <i>gloves</i> from France:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Queen said, &#8216;That can&#8217;t be:</span><br />
If you go there for <i>glove-making</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is without the <i>g</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

<p>353. &#8220;<i>Egad!</i> what great good luck!&#8221; This word is now inelegantly used,
except in certain species of poetry, where it is introduced with much
effect, as in the following distich:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;All tragedies, <i>egad!</i> to me sound oddly;<br />
I can no more be serious, than you godly.&#8221;</p>

<p>354. &#8220;The frigate is now in the Yellow Sea, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> <i>thereabouts</i>:&#8221; say,
<i>thereabout</i>. This term is a transposed combination of <i>about there</i>;
there is no such word as <i>thereabouts</i>. The same may be said of
<i>hereabouts</i>, and <i>whereabouts</i>.</p>

<p>355. &#8220;Whether he will or <i>no</i>:&#8221; say, <i>not</i>. The reason of this correction
is clearly seen by supplying what is needed to complete the sense: Whether
he will or <i>will not</i>.</p>

<p>356. &#8220;He looked at it first <i>lengthways</i>, then <i>sideways</i>:&#8221; say,
<i>lengthwise</i> and <i>sidewise</i>. Also, say <i>otherwise</i> instead of <i>otherways</i>.
A nobleman said to his fool, &#8220;I am <i>wise</i>, and you are <i>otherwise</i>.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied his jester, &#8220;you are <i>wise</i>, and I am <i>another wise</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>357. If you are a landlord, beware of incorrectly using such an expression
as in the following: A landed proprietor went to a tenant with a view of
increasing his rent, and said to him, &#8220;Neighbor, I am going to <i>raise your
rent</i>.&#8221; &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;for I am utterly unable to
<i>raise it myself</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>358. &#8220;Will you <i>accept</i> of this slight testimonial?&#8221; Omit <i>of</i>, which is
superfluous, and weakens the sentence.</p>

<p>359. &#8220;He convinced his opponent by <i>dint</i> of good reasoning:&#8221; <i>dint</i>,
meaning <i>force</i> or strength, is an obsolete word, and should not now be employed.</p>

<p>360. &#8220;The Danube <i>empties</i> into the Black Sea:&#8221; say, <i>flows</i>; to <i>empty</i>
means <i>to make vacant</i>; no river can properly be called <i>empty</i>, until it
is entirely dried up.</p>

<p>361. Such words as <i>bamboozle</i>, <i>topsyturvy</i>, <i>helterskelter</i>,
<i>hurlyburly</i>, and <i>pellmell</i> are generally to be avoided. They answer,
however, for familiar conversation.</p>

<p>362. Never say <i>seraphims</i>, for the plural of <i>seraph</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> but <i>seraphim</i>;
the same rule holds with <i>cherubims</i>. <i>Cherubs</i> and <i>seraphs</i> are proper
plurals, suiting a familiar style of speaking or writing, while <i>cherubim</i>
and <i>seraphim</i> are to be used only in more dignified and solemn discourse.</p>

<p>363. &#8220;<i>There&#8217;s</i> the books you wanted:&#8221; say, <i>there are</i>: avoid all
abbreviations when they lead to a grammatical error, as in the present instance.</p>

<p>364. &#8220;This prisoner has, of all the gang, committed <i>fewer</i> misdemeanors:&#8221;
say, <i>fewest</i>. We may say <i>fewer than</i> all, but we must say <i>fewest of</i> all.</p>

<p>365. &#8220;I esteem you more than <i>the others</i>:&#8221; this sentence is equivocal.
Does it mean, &#8220;I esteem you more than <i>I esteem the others</i>,&#8221; or, &#8220;I
esteem you more than <i>the others esteem you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>366. &#8220;The most eminent scholars will, on some points, differ <i>among one
another</i>:&#8221; say, <i>among themselves</i>.</p>

<p>367. &#8220;He, from that moment, doubled his <i>kindness and caresses of me</i>:&#8221;
say, &#8220;kindness <i>for</i> and caresses of me;&#8221; by omitting <i>caresses</i> we have,
&#8220;He doubled his <i>kindness of</i> me,&#8221; which is not good English.</p>

<p>368. <i>To differ from</i> and <i>to differ with</i>: to <i>differ from</i> a man means
to have an opinion different from his; to <i>differ with</i> a person signifies
a <i>quarrel</i> or <i>rupture</i>.</p>

<p>369. &#8220;He barely escaped having <i>one or two broken heads</i>:&#8221; a man has but
<i>one</i> head, let it be broken or whole. Say, &#8220;He <i>once or twice barely
escaped</i> having a broken head.&#8221;</p>

<p>370. &#8220;Whenever <i>I fall into that man&#8217;s conversation</i> I am entertained and
profited:&#8221; say, <i>fall into conversation with that man</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>371. &#8220;The lecturer <i>spoke to several points</i>:&#8221; say, &#8220;spoke <i>on</i> several
points.&#8221; He spoke <i>to</i> his audience.</p>

<p>372. &#8220;I shall regard your <i>strictures</i> only so far as <i>concerns</i> my own
errors:&#8221; say, <i>concern</i>; the phrase when filled out should read, &#8220;only so
far as <i>they concern</i> my own errors.&#8221;</p>

<p>373. &#8220;I found him better than I expected <i>to have found him</i>:&#8221; say, <i>to find him</i>.</p>

<p>374. &#8220;I perceived that he was totally blind <i>with half an eye</i>:&#8221; say, &#8220;I
perceived, with half an eye, that he was totally blind.&#8221; Otherwise, to a
man <i>totally blind</i> you allot <i>half an eye</i>!</p>

<p>375. The word <i>only</i> is often wrongly placed in the sentence, and made to
express an idea which is not designed to be conveyed. &#8220;Not <i>only</i> Chinese
are superstitious,&#8221; implies that others besides the Chinese are
superstitious. &#8220;Chinese are not <i>only</i> superstitious,&#8221; implies that in
addition to being superstitious, they have some other characteristics.
&#8220;Chinese not <i>only</i> are superstitious,&#8221; leaves room for something still
further to be implied of the Chinese than superstition, and which is not
necessarily the predicate of <i>are</i>; as, &#8220;Chinese not only are
superstitious, but they persecute those who do not put faith in Confucius.&#8221;</p>

<p>376. <i>Not the least</i> and <i>nothing less than</i>, sometimes literally convey
just the opposite of what is intended. &#8220;He has <i>not the least</i> excuse for
going,&#8221; may mean that he has <i>a great excuse</i>, or <i>none at all</i>. &#8220;He seeks
<i>nothing less than</i> worldly honor,&#8221; may signify that nothing inferior to
worldly honor will satisfy his desire; or, on the other hand, it may mean
that nothing is less sought by him than worldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> honor. Such expressions,
therefore, are to be used with caution, else they will mislead.</p>

<p>377. Care should be taken in the use of epithets. For instance, in the
sentence, &#8220;<i>A wise and good man</i> should be respected,&#8221; the words <i>wise</i> and
<i>good</i> may properly be applied to the same man; but if the sentence should
be altered to read, &#8220;An <i>old and young man</i>,&#8221; it is obvious that both
epithets could not relate to the same person.</p>

<p>378. Never say <i>turkle soup</i>, for <i>turtle soup</i>.</p>

<p>379. The word <i>long</i> should not now be employed to signify <i>many</i>. An
example of this early usage is found in the Fifth Commandment, &#8220;that thy
days may be <i>long</i> upon the land.&#8221; The following lines furnish an instance
of the verb <i>to lengthen</i>, meaning to <i>make many</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">&#8220;The best of all ways</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To <i>lengthen</i> our days,</span><br />
Is to take a few hours from the night, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>380. &#8220;They returned <i>back again</i> to the <i>same</i> city <i>from</i> whence they
came <i>forth</i>:&#8221; omit the italicized words, which are redundant and inelegant.</p>

<p>381. &#8220;Have you any leisure <i>upon your hands</i>?&#8221; omit <i>upon your
hands</i>,&mdash;not so much because anything after &#8220;leisure&#8221; is superfluous, in
such a sentence, as because the idea of <i>having leisure upon your hands</i> is absurd.</p>

<p>382. &#8220;Seven lads were present, and he gave them <i>all</i> a book:&#8221; say, <i>gave
them each</i> a book. <i>All</i> refers to a number of persons or things taken
<i>collectively</i>, as <i>one body</i>; <i>each</i> refers to <i>every individual</i>, separately considered.</p>

<p>383. &#8220;Lend me your <i>umberell</i>:&#8221; say, <i>umbrella</i>. The former pronunciation,
however, is allowed by <i>poetic license</i>, as in the following, adapted from
Thomas Moore:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
&#8220;Oh, ever thus from childhood&#8217;s hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has chilling fate upon me fell!</span><br />
There always comes a soakin&#8217; shower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I hain&#8217;t got an <i>umbrell</i>.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>384. We lately met a grammarian, who had just made a tour through the
mines, conjugating, or, rather, cogitating thus: &#8220;Positive, <i>mine</i>;
comparative <i>miner</i>; superlative, <i>minus</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>385. &#8220;Put not thy secret into the mouth of the <i>Bosphorus</i>, for it will
betray it to the ears of the Black Sea.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Oriental Proverb.</i>) Pronounce
<i>Bosphorus</i> as if written <i>Bosforus</i>, and not <i>Bos-porous</i>.</p>

<p>386. Be careful to use the hyphen (-) correctly: it joins compound words,
and words broken by the ending of a line. The use of the hyphen will
appear more clearly from the following example: &#8220;<i>many colored</i> wings&#8221;
means <i>many</i> wings which are <i>colored</i>; but &#8220;<i>many-colored</i> wings&#8221; means
&#8220;wings of <i>many colors</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>387. &#8220;I am <i>afraid</i> it will rain:&#8221; say, <i>I fear</i>. <i>Afraid</i> expresses
terror; <i>fear</i> may mean only <i>anxiety</i>.</p>

<p>388. Never say <i>o-fences</i> for <i>offences</i>; <i>pison</i> for <i>poison</i>;
<i>co-lection</i> for <i>collection</i>; <i>voiolent</i> for <i>violent</i>; <i>kivver</i> for
<i>cover</i>; <i>afeard</i> for <i>afraid</i>; <i>debbuty</i> for <i>deputy</i>. The last three
examples are very common.</p>

<p>389. &#8220;It is a mere <i>cipher</i>:&#8221; never spell <i>cipher</i> with a <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>390. &#8220;I was <i>necessitated</i> to do it:&#8221; a poor expression, and often made
worse by <i>necessiated</i> being used: say, I was <i>obliged</i>, or <i>compelled</i>,
to do it.</p>

<p>391. &#8220;Gibbon wrote the <i>Rise</i> and Fall of the Roman Empire:&#8221; pronounce

<i>regiment</i>.</p>

<p>393. &#8220;He bought a <i>gimlet</i>:&#8221; never spell the last word <i>gimblet</i>, as many do.</p>

<p>394. &#8220;He is a supporter of the <i>Government</i>:&#8221; beware of omitting the <i>n</i>
in the second syllable of <i>Government</i>&mdash;a very common practice.</p>

<p>395. &#8220;Received this day <i>of</i> Mr. Brown ten dollars:&#8221; say, &#8220;Received this
day <i>from</i>,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>396. &#8220;Of whatever you <i>get</i>, endeavor to save something; and with all your
<i>getting, get</i> wisdom:&#8221; carefully avoid saying <i>git</i> for <i>get</i>, and
<i>gitting</i> for <i>getting</i>.</p>

<p>397. &#8220;So intent was he on the song he was <i>singing</i>, while he stood by the
fire, that he did not perceive that his clothes were <i>singeing</i>.&#8221; Verbs
ending with a <i>single e</i>, omit the <i>e</i> when the termination <i>ing</i> is
added, as, <i>give</i>, <i>giving</i>; in <i>singeing</i>, however, the <i>e</i> must be
retained, to prevent its being confounded with <i>singing</i>. The <i>e</i> must
also be retained in <i>dyeing</i>, to distinguish it from <i>dying</i>.</p>

<p>398. The following sentences may be studied: &#8220;The <i>dyer dyes</i> daily, yet
he <i>dies</i> not.&#8221; &#8220;The <i>miner minds</i> the <i>minor mines</i>.&#8221; &#8220;It is not <i>meet</i>
to <i>mete</i> out such <i>meat</i>.&#8221; &#8220;He performed a great <i>feat</i> with his <i>feet</i>
at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.&#8221; (<i>F&ecirc;te</i> is pronounced <i>fate</i>.)</p>

<p>399. &#8220;<i>Lower</i> the sails, as the sky begins to <i>lower</i>:&#8221; pronounce <i>low</i> in
the <i>former</i> so as to rhyme with <i>mow</i>, and <i>low</i> in the <i>latter</i> so as to rhyme with <i>cow</i>.</p>

<p>400. &#8220;There was a great <i>row</i> on Monday, in Tryon <i>Row</i>:&#8221; pronounce the
former <i>row</i> so as to rhyme with <i>cow</i>&mdash;the latter <i>row</i>, so as to rhyme with <i>mo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>401. &#8220;His <i>surname</i> is Clifford:&#8221; never spell the <i>sur</i> in &#8220;surname&#8221;
<i>sir</i>, which shows an ignorance of its true derivation, which is from the Latin.</p>

<p>402. &#8220;The buildings are so old that they pay <i>almost no rent</i> now:&#8221;
<i>scarcely any rent</i>, is better.</p>

<p>403. &#8220;His <i>mamma</i> sent him to a preparatory school:&#8221; <i>mamma</i> is often
written with one <i>m</i> only, which is not, as may at first be supposed, in
imitation of the French <i>maman</i>, but in sheer ignorance.</p>

<p>404. Active verbs often take a neuter sense; as, &#8220;<i>The house is
building</i>:&#8221; here, <i>is building</i> is used in a neuter signification, because
it has no object after it. By this rule are explained such sentences as,
&#8220;<i>Application is wanting</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>The Grammar is printing</i>,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>405. &#8220;He <i>attackted</i> me without the slightest provocation:&#8221; say, <i>attacked</i>.</p>

but incorrect; say, <i>successively</i>.</p>

<p>407. &#8220;I fear I shall <i>discommode</i> you:&#8221; it is better to say, <i>incommode</i>.</p>

<p>408. &#8220;I can do it <i>equally as well as</i> he:&#8221; leave out <i>equally</i>, which is superfluous.</p>

<p>409. &#8220;We could not forbear <i>from</i> doing it:&#8221; leave out <i>from</i>, which is
unnecessary; or say, <i>refrain from</i>.</p>

<p>410. &#8220;He was totally dependent <i>of</i> his father:&#8221; say, dependent <i>on</i> his father.</p>

<p>411. &#8220;They accused him <i>for</i> neglecting his duty:&#8221; say, <i>of</i> neglecting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>412. &#8220;They have a great resemblance <i>with</i> each other:&#8221; say, <i>to</i> each other.</p>

<p>413. &#8220;I entirely dissent <i>with</i> him:&#8221; say, <i>from</i> him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>414. &#8220;He was made much <i>on</i> at the Springs:&#8221; say, made much <i>of</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>415. &#8220;He is a man <i>on</i> whom you can confide:&#8221; say, <i>in</i> whom, &amp;c.</p>

<p>416. &#8220;He was obliged to <i>fly</i> the country:&#8221; say, <i>flee</i> the country. A very common mistake.</p>

<p>417. &#8220;The snuffers <i>wants</i> mending:&#8221; say, <i>want</i> mending. No one would
say, &#8220;My <i>pantaloons is</i> ripped.&#8221;</p>

<p>418. &#8220;His conduct admits <i>of</i> no apology:&#8221; omit <i>of</i>, which is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>419. &#8220;A <i>gent</i> has been here inquiring for you:&#8221; a detestable, but very
common expression; say, a <i>gentleman</i> has been, &amp;c. Oliver Wendell Holmes
hits off this liberty with language, in the following happy couplet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;The things called <i>pants</i>, in certain documents,<br />
Were never made for <i>gentlemen</i>, but <i>gents</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>420. &#8220;That was <i>all along of</i> you:&#8221; say, &#8220;That was <i>all your fault</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>421. &#8220;You have no <i>call</i> to be angry with me:&#8221; say, no <i>occasion</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>422. &#8220;Too free an <i>indulgence</i> in luxuries <i>enervate</i> and <i>injure</i> the
system:&#8221; say, <i>enervates</i> and <i>injures</i>, &amp;c. The plural, <i>luxuries</i>,
standing directly before the verb, (which should be <i>enervates</i>, in the
singular,) deceives the ear. Errors of this kind are very common, though a
moment&#8217;s thought would correct them. The verb must agree with its subject
in person and in number; if the <i>noun</i> is in the singular, the <i>verb</i> that
belongs to it must also be in the singular.</p>

<p>423. &#8220;A father divided a portion of his property <i>among</i> his two children,
and the remainder he distributed <i>between</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> the poor:&#8221; say, <i>between</i> his
two children, and <i>among</i> the poor. <i>Between</i> is applicable to two only, <i>among</i> to three or more.</p>

<p>424. &#8220;<i>Every</i> child should obey <i>their</i> parents:&#8221; say, <i>his</i> parents. The
pronoun must agree with the noun in number, &amp;c.</p>

<p>425. &#8220;He is a person <i>who</i> I respect greatly:&#8221; say, <i>whom</i>. &#8220;Be careful
<i>who</i> you trust:&#8221; <i>whom</i> you trust.</p>

<p>426. &#8220;Let me consider <i>of</i> this matter.&#8221; &#8220;The culprit dreaded to enter
<i>in</i> the prison.&#8221; &#8220;The laborers were not allowed to want <i>for</i> anything.&#8221;
Leave out the <i>italicized</i> words&mdash;the sense being complete without them.</p>

<p>427. <i>Cupola</i> is often pronounced <i>cupalo</i>; <i>foliage</i>, <i>foilage</i>;
<i>future</i>, <i>futur</i>; <i>nature</i>, <i>natur</i>: all of which errors should be
carefully avoided.</p>

<p>428. &#8220;&#8217;Ow &#8217;appens it that <i>H</i>englishmen so <i>h</i>often misplace their
<i>h</i>aitches?&#8221; It is a cockneyism; and if you have fallen into the habit, it
will require perhaps more perseverance than you imagine, to correct it.</p>

<p>429. Do you say <i>w</i>agabond or <i>v</i>agabond, <i>w</i>inegar or <i>v</i>inegar, <i>w</i>ery
or <i>v</i>ery, <i>v</i>alking or <i>w</i>alking, <i>v</i>atchman or <i>w</i>atchman? It is a local
custom, but if you have any taint of it, don&#8217;t sing &#8220;<i>V</i>illikins and his
Dinah.&#8221;</p>

<p>430. Provid<i>ence</i>, confid<i>ence</i>, and similar words, are often pronounced
Provid<i>unce</i>, confid<i>unce</i>, &amp;c., substituting <i>unce</i> for <i>ence</i>. So also,
words ending in <i>ance</i>, as mainte<i>nance</i>, suste<i>nance</i>, <span class="smcap">surveil</span><i>lance</i>,
are pronounced falsely mainten<i>unce</i>, susten<i>unce</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>431. <i>Coming</i>, <i>going</i>, <i>according</i>, &amp;c., are often pronounced without the
final <i>g</i>: speak them distinctly, and pronounce difficult words with
de-lib-er-a-tion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>432. If you are a Yankee, you should (though, as a general thing, you
<i>will not</i>) take special pains with your vowel sounds, that they be not
formed through the nasal cavities. Don&#8217;t say <i>heow</i>, <i>ceow</i>, <i>confeound</i>,
for <i>how</i>, <i>cow</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>433. If you are a Western man, you are liable to give your vowel sounds
too great breadth. You should not say <i>bar</i> for <i>bear</i>, <i>hum</i> for <i>home</i>,
<i>dawlar</i> for <i>dollar</i>; and it is better to avoid using such expressions as
<i>I reckon</i>, <i>I guess</i>, <i>I calculate</i>, too frequently.</p>

<p>434. &#8220;I am going <i>a fishing</i>:&#8221; be bold enough to be one among the foremost
to break away from the bad habit of saying <i>a fishing</i>, <i>a talking</i>, <i>a
courting</i>, &amp;c. This custom, however, should be retained in quoting
proverbs and wise sayings; these are better in proportion as they are
older; for example: &#8220;<i>Who goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing.</i>&#8221; The
quaintness would be destroyed by saying simply <i>borrowing</i> and <i>sorrowing</i>.</p>

<p>435. Some people add a superfluous preposition at the end of a
sentence&mdash;&#8220;More than you think <i>for</i>.&#8221; This is awkward.</p>

<p>436. &#8220;Then think <i>on</i> the friend who once welcomed it too,&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c.: say, <i>of</i>.</p>

<p>437. <i>Thou</i> and <i>thee</i> are no longer used in spelling or writing, except
by some of The Friends; but proverbial citations, originally expressed in
that form, lose much of their beauty and force by alteration; as, &#8220;If thou
seest thy house in flames, approach and warm thyself by it.&#8221; How greatly
would a change of person tame the spirit of this fine proverb!</p>

<p>438. &#8220;By the street of &#8216;<i>By-and-By</i>,&#8217; one arrives at the house of
&#8216;Never.&#8217;&#8221; Do not say, <i>By&#8217;mby</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>439. Be careful to observe the <i>two plurals</i> of the following nouns:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="plurals">

<p>440. Different shades of meaning may be expressed by slight variations in
the position of the important words in a sentence. For example, &#8220;<i>The
Paradise Lost of Milton</i>,&#8221; is not exactly the same in import as,
&#8220;<i>Milton&#8217;s Paradise Lost</i>;&#8221; in the former, attention is called to the
author&mdash;in the latter, to the poem.</p>

<p>441. In uniting the plural of <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three,</i> do not use the
apostrophe [&#8217;] as <i>one&#8217;s</i>, <i>two&#8217;s</i>, <i>three&#8217;s.</i> Good writers never conform
to the latter mode. Wordsworth, who was remarkably particular, not only in
the choice of his words but in their orthography, wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;The sun has long been set,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stars are out by <i>twos and threes</i>;</span><br />
The little birds are piping yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the bushes and the trees.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>442. &#8220;<i>How&#8217;s yourself</i>, this morning?&#8221; an exceedingly common, but very
objectionable expression: say, &#8220;<i>How are you</i>;&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>443. &#8220;Wanted, two apprentices, who will be treated as <i>one</i> of the
family:&#8221; great practical difficulty would be found in realizing such
treatment! Say, &#8220;as <i>members</i> of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>444. The following lines afford an instance of the ingenious uses to which
the English language may be put:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;You <i>sigh for</i> a <i>cipher</i>, but <i>I sigh for you;</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, <i>sigh for no cipher</i>, but oh, <i>sigh for me;</i></span><br />
Oh, let not my <i>sigh for</i> a <i>cipher</i> go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But give <i>sigh for sigh, for I sigh</i> for you so!&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The above is more briefly expressed in the following manner:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;U O a O, but I O u,<br />
Oh, O no O, but oh, O me;<br />
Oh, let not my O a O go,<br />
But give O O I O u so!&#8221;</p>

<p>445. Sometimes <i>but</i> is incorrectly substituted for <i>that</i>: as, &#8220;I have no
doubt <i>but</i> he will be here to-night.&#8221; Sometimes for the conjunction <i>if</i>,
as, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder <i>but</i> that was the case.&#8221; And sometimes <i>two</i>
conjunctions are used instead of one, as, &#8220;<i>If that</i> I have offended him,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>After that</i> he had seen the parties,&#8221; &amp;c. All this is very awkward and
should be avoided.</p>

<p>446. &#8220;My hands are <i>chopped</i>:&#8221; say, <i>chapped</i>.</p>

<p>447. &#8220;This will serve as a <i>preventative</i>:&#8221; say, <i>preventive</i>.</p>

<p>448. &#8220;A <i>nishe</i> young man,&#8221; &#8220;What <i>makesh</i> you laugh?&#8221; &#8220;If he <i>offendsh</i>
you, don&#8217;t speak to him,&#8221; &#8220;<i>Ash</i> you please,&#8221; &#8220;Not <i>jush</i> yet,&#8221; &#8220;We
always <i>passh</i> your house in going to call on <i>Missh Yatesh</i>.&#8221; This is
decided, unmitigated <i>cockneyism</i>, having its parallel in nothing except
the broken English of the sons of Abraham, and to adopt it in conversation
is certainly &#8220;not speaking like a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>449. Never say, &#8220;Cut it in <i>half</i>,&#8221; for this you cannot do unless you
could <i>annihilate one</i> half. You may &#8220;cut it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> two,&#8221; or &#8220;cut it in
halves,&#8221; or &#8220;cut it through,&#8221; or &#8220;divide it,&#8221; but no human ability will
enable you <i>to cut it in half</i>.</p>

<p>451. <i>To lay and to lie.</i>&mdash;<i>To lay</i> is an active or transitive verb, and
must always have an object, expressed or understood. <i>To lie</i> (not meaning
<i>to tell a falsehood</i>) is a neuter or intransitive, and therefore does not
admit of an object. The only real difficulty arises from the fact, that
the past tense of &#8220;lie,&#8221; when used without an auxiliary, is the same as
the present of &#8220;lay.&#8221; But a little attention will obviate this. Nothing
can be more erroneous than to say, &#8220;I shall go and lay down.&#8221; The question
which naturally arises in the mind of the discriminating hearer is,
&#8220;<i>What</i> are you going to lay down&mdash;money, carpets, plans, or what?&#8221; for,
as a transitive verb is used, an object is wanted to complete the sense.
The speaker means, that he himself is going to <i>lie down</i>. &#8220;My brother
<i>lays</i> ill of a fever,&#8221; should be, &#8220;My brother <i>lies</i>,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>452. Many people have an odd way of saying, &#8220;I expect,&#8221; when they mean
only &#8220;I think,&#8221; or &#8220;I conclude;&#8221; as, &#8220;I expect my brother went to Richmond
to-day,&#8221; &#8220;I expect those books were sent to Paris last year.&#8221; <i>Expect</i> can
relate only to <i>future</i> time, and must be followed by a future tense, or a
verb in the infinitive mood; as, &#8220;I expect my brother <i>will go</i> to
Richmond to-day,&#8221; &#8220;I expect <i>to find</i> those books were sent to Paris last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>453. &#8220;A <i>summer&#8217;s</i> morning,&#8221; should be, A <i>summer</i> morning.</p>

<p>454. The vulgar speaker uses adjectives instead of adverbs, and says,
&#8220;This letter is written <i>shocking</i>;&#8221; the genteel speaker uses adverbs
instead of adjectives, and says, &#8220;This writing looks <i>shockingly</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>460. A grammatical play upon the word <span class="smcap">that</span>:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Now <i>that</i> is a word which may often be joined,<br />
For <i>that that</i> may be doubled is clear to the mind;<br />
And <i>that that that</i> is right, is as plain to the view,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>461. &#8220;He will go <i>from thence</i> to-morrow.&#8221; The preposition &#8220;from&#8221; is
included in these adverbs, therefore it becomes tautology in sense when prefixed to them.</p>

<p>462. &#8220;Equally as well,&#8221; is a very common expression, and a very incorrect
one; the adverb of comparison, &#8220;as,&#8221; has no right in the sentence.
&#8220;Equally well,&#8221; &#8220;Equally high,&#8221; &#8220;Equally dear,&#8221; should be the
construction; and if a complement be necessary in the phrase, it should be
preceded by the preposition &#8220;with,&#8221; as, &#8220;The wall was equally high with
the former one,&#8221; &#8220;The goods at Smith&#8217;s are equally dear with those sold at

been injured by the storm,&#8221; &#8220;Either of the children <i>are</i> at liberty to
claim it.&#8221; Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> it will be perceived that the pronouns &#8220;one,&#8221; &#8220;each,&#8221;
&#8220;every,&#8221; &#8220;either,&#8221; are the true nominatives to the verbs; but the
intervening noun in the plural number, in each sentence, deludes the ear;
and the speaker, without reflection, renders the verb in the plural
instead of the singular number.</p>

<p>469. &#8220;Many still die annually <i>from</i> the plague:&#8221; say, <i>of</i> the plague.</p>

<p>472. &#8220;This is the more <i>perfect</i> of the two:&#8221; say, More <i>complete</i>.
<i>Perfect</i> rarely admits comparison.</p>

<p>473. Avoid all slang and vulgar words and phrases, as, <i>Anyhow</i>, <i>Bating</i>,
<i>Bran new</i>, <i>To blow up</i>, <i>Bother</i>, <i>Cut</i>, <i>Currying favor</i>, <i>Fork out</i>,
<i>Half an eye</i>, <i>I am up to you</i>, <i>Kick up</i>, <i>Scrape</i>, <i>The Scratch</i>, <i>Walk into</i>.</p>

<p>479. &#8220;We both were <i>very disappointed</i>.&#8221; This is an incomplete expression:
say, <i>very much</i>, or <i>very greatly</i>. No one would think of saying, &#8220;We both were <i>very pleased</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>480. &#8220;It is I who <i>is</i> to receive the appointment:&#8221; say, who <i>am</i> to
receive; <i>who</i> is in the first person, and the verb of which it is the subject must be in the same.</p>

<p>481. Never say <i>biscake</i>, for <i>biscuit</i>.</p>

<p>482. &#8220;Passengers are <i>not requested</i> to let down the chains, before the
boat is fastened to the bridge.&#8221; [From a printed regulation on one of the
New-York and Brooklyn ferry-boats.] The reading should be, &#8220;Passengers
<i>are requested not to let down</i> the chains.&#8221;</p>

<p>483. &#8220;How will you <i>swap</i> jack-knives?&#8221; <i>swap,</i> although it is a word
familiarly used in connection with &#8220;jack-knives,&#8221; is a term that cannot
lay the least claim to elegance. Use some other of the many mercantile
expressions to which trade has given rise.</p>

<p>484. &#8220;He&#8217;s put his nose to the <i>grin-stone</i> at an early age.&#8221; [A remark
usually made by old ladies, suggested by the first marriage among their
grandsons.] Say, <i>grind-stone</i>. A <i>grin-stone</i> implies a stone that
&#8220;grins,&#8221; whereas, especially in this instance, the &#8220;nose&#8221; fulfills that
office.</p>

<p>485. The importance of punctuating a written sentence is often neglected.
Space does not permit the giving of rules on this subject, in this book.
Business correspondence is generally blemished by many omissions of this
character; for example, &#8220;Messrs G Longman &amp; Co have recd a note from the
Cor Sec Nat Shipwreck Soc informing them of the loss of one of their
vessels off the N E Coast of S A at 8 P M on the 20 of Jan.&#8221; A clergyman,
standing in his pulpit, was once handed a slip of paper, to be read in the
hearing of the congregation, which was intended to convey the following
notice: &#8220;A man going to sea, his wife desires the prayers of the church.&#8221;
But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> sentence was improperly punctuated, and he read, &#8220;A man going to
see his wife, desires the prayers of the church!&#8221;</p>

<p>486. &#8220;The knave thereupon commenced rifling his <i>friend&#8217;s</i> (as he called
him) <i>pocket</i>:&#8221; say, &#8220;The knave commenced rifling the <i>pocket of his
friend</i>, as he facetiously called him.&#8221; The possessive case, and the word
that governs it, must not be separated by an intervening clause.</p>

<p>487. &#8220;I owe <i>thee</i> a heavy debt of gratitude, and <i>you</i> will not permit me
to repay it:&#8221; say, either &#8220;I owe <i>you</i>,&#8221; &amp;c., preserving &#8220;and <i>you</i> will&#8221;
in the second clause; or, &#8220;I owe <i>thee</i>,&#8221; and altering &#8220;and <i>you</i> will&#8221; into
&#8220;and <i>thou wilt</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>488. &#8220;Every lancer and every rifleman <i>were at their post</i>:&#8221; say, <i>was at his</i> post.</p>

<p>489. &#8220;I can lift as many pounds <i>as he has</i>:&#8221; add <i>lifted</i>.</p>

<p>490. Do not use <i>to</i>, the sign of the infinitive mood, for the infinitive
itself. &#8220;I have not written to him, and I am not likely <i>to</i>,&#8221; should
read, &#8220;I am not likely <i>to write to him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>491. The word <i>agree</i> is sometimes followed by the wrong preposition. We
should say, agree <i>with</i> a person&mdash;<i>to</i> a proposition&mdash;<i>upon</i> a thing
among ourselves.</p>

<p>492. We should say <i>compare with</i>, in respect of quality&mdash;<i>compare to</i>,
for the sake of illustration.</p>

<p>493. We should say copy <i>after</i> a person&mdash;<i>copy from</i> a thing.</p>

<p>494. <i>Between</i> is properly applied only to two objects; <i>among</i>, to three
or more. &#8220;A father divided a portion of his property <i>between</i> his two
sons; the rest he distributed <i>among</i> the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>495. <i>In</i> should not be used for <i>into</i>, after verbs denoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> entrance.
&#8220;Come <i>in</i> my parlor,&#8221; should read, &#8220;Come <i>into</i> my parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p>496. &#8220;We confide <i>in</i>, and have respect <i>for</i>, the good.&#8221; Such a form of
expression is strained and awkward. It is better to say, &#8220;We confide <i>in</i>
the good, and have respect for <i>them</i>,&#8221; or, &#8220;We <i>trust</i> and <i>respect</i> the good.&#8221;</p>

<p>497. &#8220;This veil of flesh parts the visible and the invisible world:&#8221; say,
&#8220;parts the visible <i>from</i> the invisible.&#8221; It certainly is not meant that
the veil of flesh <i>parts</i> (or <i>divides</i>) each of these worlds.</p>

<p>498. &#8220;Every leaf, every twig, every blade, every drop of water, <i>teem</i>
with life:&#8221; say, <i>teems</i>.</p>

<p>499. &#8220;Dr. Prideaux used to relate that when he brought the manuscript of
his Connection of the Old and the New Testaments to the publisher, <i>he
told him</i> it was a dry subject, and that the printing could not be safely
ventured upon unless he could enliven the work with a little humor.&#8221; The
sense alone, and not the <i>sentence</i>, indicates to whom <i>he</i> and <i>him</i>
respectively refer; such a form of expression is faulty, because it may
lead to a violation of <i>perspicuity</i>, which is one of the most essential
qualities of a good style.</p>

<p>500. The last direction which this little book will give, on the subject
with which it has been occupied, is one that long ago was given in the
greatest of books&mdash;&#8220;Let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel of
Christ.&#8221; If obedience to this injunction may not guard him who heeds it
against the commission of such mistakes as are numbered in this catalogue,
it will not fail to lead him out of the way of errors more grievous and
solemn.</p>

<h3>THE</h3>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/speller.png" alt="SPELLER AND DEFINER'S MANUAL" /></div>

<p class="center"><big>BY WILLIAM W. SMITH,</big></p>
<p class="center"> Principal of Grammar School No. 1, New-York; Author
of The Speller&#8217;s Manual.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/bar.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>This work contains about fourteen thousand of the most useful words in the
English language, correctly spelled, pronounced, defined, and arranged in
classes, together with rules for spelling, prefixes and suffixes, with
their significations, rules for use of capitals, punctuation and other
marks used in writing and printing, quotations from other languages used
in English composition, abbreviations, &amp;c., to which is added a <b>Vocabulary</b>
for reference. Words which resemble each other in pronunciation, but have
different meanings, are arranged together, and occupy about one eighth of
the entire work, containing nearly three hundred pages. The sentences for
examples for pupils (each embracing two or more of these words) will be
found very instructive and interesting. While <b>The Speller and Definer&#8217;s
Manual</b> supplies all that can be desired in an ordinary dictionary or
speller, it furnishes much important information that cannot be found in
these, and presents a study, usually dry and uninteresting, in a natural
and attractive manner. It is adapted to the capacities of children, and
will essentially aid the teacher in the work of instruction by suggesting
<i>questions</i> and <i>ideas</i> that are very often overlooked amid the anxieties
of the school-room.</p>

<p>It will be found to be one of the most useful works for schools or
<b>SELF-INSTRUCTION</b> ever issued as a text-book, and its examination will
abundantly repay any friend of education.</p>

<p>The Manual has been adopted by the Board of Education for use in the
Public Schools of New-York City.</p>

<p>We invite attention to the following extracts of notices of this work from
city papers:</p>

<h3>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<p>&#8220;The volume is not only valuable as a text-book for schools, but will be

<p>&#8220;We like the plan and execution of this new work, and recommend it to the
attention of teachers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Life Illustrated.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The author of this excellent little manual is the principal of one of our
grammar schools, and is well known as a teacher. If his manual have any
fault, it is that of <i>brevity</i>, for the principle upon which it is
constructed, strikes us as perfect.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New-York Courier.</i></p>

<p>The <i>first essential</i> of good reading is a <i>distinct articulation</i>. This
can only result from practice of the elementary sounds and their
combinations. All of these simple elements and their combinations are
given, with ample directions, arranged in the simplest and most compact
form, in the first books of Tower&#8217;s series.</p>

<p>The <i>next points</i> are <i>Emphasis</i> and the <i>Tones</i>.</p>

<p>These are set forth and illustrated in the last three Readers. The
elements of expression requisite for the utterance of every sentiment are
clearly described and explained by appropriate examples. By these
examples, it is clearly shown how a passage is to be read, and thence is
deduced a rule or principle that all similar passages are to be read in a
similar manner.</p>

<p>The character of the selections is such as to claim the attention of all
who are in search of good reading matter. They are exciting, instructive,
and interesting, and admirably adapted to the capacity of the pupils.</p>

<p>The higher books of the series contain selections from authors who are
considered standards in their respective departments. The dignity and
objects of literature are distinctly brought to view, whether in the form
of prose to persuade and instruct&mdash;in that of poetry, to please the
fancy&mdash;or in that of the drama, to move the passions.</p>

<p>The character of the selections in these two books is such as to claim the
attention of all who are in search of <i>reading matter</i> that will <i>wear</i>.</p>

<p>The superiority of these books is acknowledged, wherever they have been
brought to a practical test. The more intelligent any school committee, or
teachers are, the more readily are these Readers appreciated, and the more
eagerly are they sought for use in the school-room. So decided is the
preference for them, among the educated, over every other series, that
they are gradually but surely superseding them all, and going into general
use in all the best schools in our country.</p>

<p>This little book was prepared for beginners, that they might feel their
way understandingly, and become interested in this sometimes dry study.
This subject is presented in a natural way, avoiding all unnecessary
innovations. The plan is simple and plain, introducing only one thing at a
time, that the pupil may see a reason for each step, and thus be led to
think. It is concise, that the whole subject may be placed before the
learner in the simplest manner and encumbered by as few words for the
memory as possible, that the interest may be kept up till he is master of
the study. By easy questions, principles are deduced from familiar
examples already explained for the sake of such inferences, that a clear
understanding of these principles and their application may be acquired,
rather than the words used to explain and describe them.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcaplc">OR, GUIDE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY THE ANALYSIS AND
COMPOSITION OF SENTENCES; WITH A SEQUEL. BY DAVID B. TOWER, A. M., AND
PROF. BENJAMIN F. TWEED, A. M.</span></p>

<p>The first object in the Gradual Lessons in Grammar, is to render the pupil
familiar with the different <span class="smcap">classes</span> of words, in the various <i>relations</i>
in which they may be used, by directing attention to the manner in which
they affect the <i>meaning</i> of the sentence. Thus it is stated, that &#8220;words
used as names are nouns.&#8221; Then follow examples of the different kinds of
nouns, and the pupil is required to tell <i>why</i> they are nouns, and to
write others, till he recognizes the noun wherever it is found.</p>

<p>The same course is then taken with reference to the verb, after which
<i>sentences</i> are introduced in their simplest form, containing only the
essential elements, and the pupil is required to analyze them and
<i>construct</i> similar sentences.</p>

<p>Then follows the adjective, and attention is called to its effect on the
meaning of the sentence. The <i>statement</i> at the head of each section is
not to be committed to memory, but is made to assist the pupil in
appreciating the <i>grammatical forms of the sentences</i> which follow. In
this manner, by the introduction of a new class of words, or the use of
the same class in a different relation, the sentence is <i>gradually built
up</i>; till, from the most simple, we have the most complex an involved
forms. The <i>technical terms</i>, denoting the various relations and
modifications, are then given, with marginal references to the
illustrations. The <i>definitions</i> and <i>rules</i> in the Sequel are deduced
from illustrations in the First Part.</p>

<p>The First Part of this Grammar has one <i>peculiar</i> advantage. It combines
<span class="smcap">Construction</span> with Analysis. On every principle developed, <i>written</i>
exercises are required of the pupils, not only to insure an understanding
of that particular principle and to perpetuate a knowledge of it, but also
to furnish gradual and continued practice in the <i>construction</i> of
sentences. This method of instruction makes <i>correct writers</i>, as it
regards the using of words <i>understandingly</i> and <i>grammatically</i> in
sentences, and prepares the pupil for the task of <i>composition</i>, by
enabling him to express his thoughts <i>correctly</i> if <i>he has</i> any.</p>

<p>&#9758; Persons who wish to acquire a knowledge of English
Grammar <b>WITHOUT A MASTER</b>, will find these works of great service. Sent
singly or together, by mail, post-paid, on receipt of price.</p>

<p>This is a very neat-looking volume, whose title, &#8220;Practical Book-keeping,&#8221;
is indicative of its leading characteristics. The specimens of accounts
presented in it are in script that closely resembles writing, and they
hence afford excellent models for imitation. The book contains four forms
of accounts, immediately following each of which is a large number of
examples for practice. In their solution, the pupil has occasion
practically to apply the knowledge he has already acquired of both
arithmetic and penmanship, while at the same time he learns Book-keeping
as he will have occasion to practice it in after life. For this purpose a
set of account books, in which the examples for practice are to be written
out by the learner, and a Key for teachers containing the solution,
accompany the book.</p>

<p>Agesilaus, king of Sparta, being asked what things he thought most proper
for boys to learn, very appropriately replied, &#8220;Those things which they
should <i>practice</i> when they become men.&#8221; Ever since it was said to Adam,
&#8220;In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread,&#8221; there has been a
necessity laid upon man not only to <i>labor,</i> but to <i>exchange</i> with others
the products of his industry, in order to secure a comfortable support.
Excepting merchants, mechanics, and professional men, very few,
comparatively, keep any accounts. The principal reason for this is found
in the fact, that when young they were not taught how to do so, and the
necessity of its being done. Considerations are presented, in the
Introduction to this work, to show some of the many advantages that would
result to individuals and to the community from making Book-keeping a
common study, and the design of the present work is to furnish a practical
system of popular Book-keeping, which may meet the wants of the great
majority of the American people.</p>

<h4>FIGURES ILLUSTRATIVE OF GESTURE, ETC.</h4>
<h3>BY RUFUS CLAGGETT, A. M.</h3>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/towerbar.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>This book is given to the public with a view to encourage the study and
practice of a branch of education which gives a tenfold vigor to all other
intellectual acquirements. Thousands of men, otherwise well educated, are
often heard to lament their neglect of Elocution in their school-boy days,
and their consequent inability to utter in public those thoughts which
they would gladly disseminate, and thereby confer a benefit on society.</p>

<p>The Selections in this work are principally from standard American
authors, and contain everything which can ennoble the mind and fill it
with exalted ideas of patriotism and virtue. At the same time, the price
of the book is so low that it can be placed in the hands of every pupil,
where, indeed, we are confident it will shortly find its way.</p>

<h3>NOTICES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Brooklyn Evening Star.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Claggett, the author of this work on Elocution, has well performed his
task, giving evidence on every page of his familiarity with the subject.
He has prepared several rules easily understood and applied, and appended
forty-eight figures illustrative of gestures. The selections, both in
prose and poetry, are carefully made with reference to the object of the
work. We should like to see the work in daily use in our schools.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the New-York Express.</i></p>

<p>The whole theory and practice of the art of Elocution is so dissected and
simplified, that the pupil cannot fail to get a thorough understanding of
the subject.</p>

<p>Places within the reach of a Carpenter, with no other necessary
preparation than an ordinary education, and a knowledge of the practical
principles of his handicraft, the highest efforts of the constructive art.
It contains practical directions for performing the most difficult tasks
of the business, for cutting every description of joints, framing and
constructing every variety of roofs, mitering, splayed work, hand railing,
&amp;c., and to all this are added tables of the weight and cohesive strength
of the different materials used in the construction of buildings, and a</p>

<p class="center">COMPLETE TREATISE ON MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS,</p>

<p>Making the reader familiar with the tools of his study. The work is</p>

<p>And should be in the hands of every Carpenter and Joiner whose ambition
reaches beyond the bench and the workshop.</p>

<p>Read the following from The Trade Journal:</p>

<p>&#8220;To just such instructions as he meets with in this work, is the writer of
this paragraph indebted for his own advancement from the journeyman&#8217;s rank
to the position he now occupies. The winter evenings spent in pursuing
such studies, would fit many a man, now skilful as a workman, to take a
higher stand among his associates, and a more useful one in the community.
The whole book, which has been a very expensive one to get up, does great
credit to the publishers, and when known generally, cannot but receive a
cordial welcome from that valuable class of men to whom we are indebted
for the shelter afforded by &#8216;the house we live in.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
